Charlie, a wreck who has lost his nerve after he was exposed during an undercover operation, is assigned to a job that involves his acting as an organized-crime envoy. He moves between the preening Fidel (Jose Zuniga), a yuppie Colombian thug, and Fulvio (Oliver Platt), whose vulgar pride in his violent streak is perverse. Eric Blakeney has come up with one of the most subtle and inspired comedies you'll see this year in his feature-film writing and directing debut. &#151; Elvis Mitchell

Like the others, ''Scream3'' belongs on the Cartoon Network. This time for a better reason: the film is funny and brisk, with enough good lines to make the comedy more satisfying than the somewhat routine but still unsettling jobs to the spine. Wes Craven and his group recognize that the franchise's real competition is not the recent hit films ''The Blair Witch Project'' or ''The Sixth Sense,'' but rather ''Scream'' itself. ''Scream 3'' doesn't skimp on jacked-up scares, but it's as much as personality show as it is a slasher film. &#151; Elvis Mitchell

Scott","Not One Less (Movie)  ","Zhang Yimou's drama enlarges the possibilities of filmmaking even as it grounds itself in one of cinema's oldest, most basic principles: the camera's ability to document reality. At the center of the film is Wei (Wei Minzhi), a 13-year-old primary school graduate who has been pressed into service as a substitute teacher in the Shuiquan Primary School. When one of her students is sent to the city to work off his parents' debts. Wei, who has been promised a bonus if she can keep her class intact (this is the source of the film's title), sets out to bring him home. And the movie, which has so far been a slow, touching study of village life, becomes something else: a work of lyrical realism that has some of the shattering, redemptive power of Vittorio De Sica's ''Bicycle Thief.'' &#151; A.O.

At a time when every obscenity or aesthetic shock tactic feels like the product of either careful market research or dutiful graduate-school training, the filth and the fury of British punk rock at its moment of impact retains a surprising dignity.

Nick Park, who also directed the fabulous Wallace and Gromit shorts, transfers all of the deftness and imagination of his shorter films into an artful big-screen realization. And this briskly paced epic uses Peter Lord's continuing satirical take on British modesty and balmy superiority.

Lucy Russell plays Grace Elliott, an English expatriate whose loyalty to the French monarchy places her in danger during the revolutionary terror of the early 1790's. Jean-Claude Dreyfus is her devoted friend and former lover, the Duke of Orleans, whose principles are far less steadfast.

Michael Caine, appearing in flashbacks, plays Jack, a London butcher whose friends, along with his son (Ray Winstone), are journeying to the seaside to scatter his ashes. Along the way, they recall Jack's life, and their own small triumphs and disappointed hopes. The restrained humor of the actors, and the unassuming intelligence of Mr. Schepisi's storytelling, combine to create an extraordinarily rich portrait of a way of life, and a web of connections, that persist in the face of personal loss and historical change. – A.

The second, more provocative half explores his career in Hollywood where he helped usher in the blaxploitation genre.

It is, by any standard, an extraordinary film, a work of narrative sweep and visual beauty that honors the history of the art form even as it extends its perspective. The story about a vendetta that threatens the happiness of the hero and the stability of his nomadic, seal-hunting clan, takes a while to establish itself, but it has the clarity and the power common to epics from the sagas of ancient Scandinavia to the westerns of the old Hollywood. Austere and violent, the movie is also touched by humor and sensuality, and full of unforgettable images of the blinding Arctic landscape.

We see this in the first sequence, when the belligerently jealous Mario (René Wanko) threatens the guys who look at his girlfriend, Klaudia (Franziska Weiss); he seems to leave pools of testosterone wherever he steps. After he forces her unwanted suitors away and floors his car through the streets of Vienna, he screams at Klaudia and throws her out of the car. We then get the credit sequence, with several groups of people shown sunning themselves under the piercing sun; the pictures could be a melting mess bringing together Francis Bacon and David Hockney. With these shots of the pale cast of characters, we can almost feel the melanoma developing. Mr. Seidl treats the chemistry of human relationships like a cancer, an enormous growth that, unchecked, leads to disease. And he fixates on flesh, scouring it with his camera to search for a trace of the humanity within. He doesn't find much; the men and women in &quot;Dog Days&quot; are broken down into bullies and victims. Mr. Seidl, who wrote the screenplay with Veronika Franz, seems determined to make an answer to &quot;American Beauty.&quot; The picture is set in a tract-house suburb, with identical houses crammed next to one another, and the lack of space and the heat make an appropriate context for the wanton mistreatment. But there is genuine curiosity in Mr. Seidl's filmmaking; he treats his story as if he were shooting a documentary.

The role of the  spoiled family housecat Snowbell (Nathan Lane) has been beefed up, and Mr. Lane turns the  character's every peevish complaint into an amusing comic barb.

Written by Frank Cottrell Boyce, the picture is an illustrated history as related by Mr. Wilson. Every time he opens his mouth, it's a roaming, hilarious monologue about Factory, by which he means himself.

The inmates, all female, are the victims of a stringently moralistic brand of Irish Catholicism, now on the wane, that used to punish unmarried young women (many in their teens) for premarital sex.  These &quot;bad girls&quot; exiled from their families and communities were forced to do slave labor in convent laundries that proliferated in Ireland until recently. &quot;The Magdalene Sisters,&quot; which tells the semifictionalized stories of four young women in one convent, is set roughly from 1964 to 1969.   Most prison movies have a monster authority figure, and so does this film. Here that ogre is the head nun, Sister Bridget (Geraldine McEwan), a twisted diabolical autocrat. In a brilliant performance, Ms. McEwan makes this character horribly believable by portraying her cruelty not as raw sadism but as righteous punishment dispensed by a religious fanatic with a warped sense of values. — Stephen Holden","2002-09-28","2003-08-29","2017-11-02 04:18:02","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/28/movies/film-festival-review-slave-labor-in-irish-convents-as-terrible-as-prison.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of The Magdalene Sisters'}",NA

But he doesn't mine the comic strip soap opera mystique so extravagantly here; everything falls into place with an almost surreal delicacy.  — Elvis Mitchell","2002-10-12","2003-02-14","2017-11-02 04:18:02","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/12/movies/film-festival-review-a-time-when-loyalty-overrides-love.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of Talk to Her'}",NA

As has happened before with this director's films, the fairly conventional story — a revenger's tragedy pitting a young Irish immigrant (Leonardo DiCaprio) against his father's killer, a nativist warlord (Daniel Day-Lewis) — is less interesting than the setting. Mr. Day-Lewis gives his character, known as Bill the Butcher, an earthy Shakespearean grandeur. In his mouth, the rough vernacular of the old New York streets becomes poetry. If Mr. DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz (in the underimagined role of a spirited pickpocket) don't shed their movie-star auras, they do show themselves to be intrepid and engaging actors. But the real achievement of the movie is in the way it brings history to life — not merely by meticulously recreating its details, but by offering a troubling and timely interpretation of how the violence and iniquity of the past continues to ramify into the present. The film, flawed and indelible, is nothing less than an attempt to reimagine the germs of America's historical identity. It suggests, with vivid plausibility, that clues to the national character can be found in the violent, contradictory and often tragic story of the urban immigrant working class. — A. O.

With relentless clarity, Mr. Polanski tracks the deterioration of his hero's situation and the day-in, day-out assault on his humanity. There are scenes of unwatchable brutality as well as of kindness and solidarity, but what is most remarkable is the sense of daily life in impossible conditions.

A childlike man of limited intelligence and no  impulse control, Stevie, as he is called, is not entirely unsympathetic, but he isn't  especially likable either. We meet his sister Brenda, the grandmother Verna, who cared  for him after his mother, Bernice, dumped him in her lap, and his mentally retarded  girlfriend Tonya. The movie, set in the hardscrabble rural world of southern Illinois, compellingly argues that the physical and psychic wounds inflicted on children  leave irreparable damage and lead to lifelong social dysfunction. — Stephen Holden","2003-03-28","","2017-11-02 04:16:22","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/28/movies/film-review-in-rural-illinois-chronicling-one-man-s-slow-fall.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of Stevie'}",NA

The main character, Grazia (Valeria Golino), is a beautiful but emotionally unstable  fisherman's wife and the mother of three whose wild mood swings and erratic behavior  begin to rankle the town and to precipitate domestic havoc. When her family and  neighbors decide to send Grazia to Milan for treatment, she runs away and hides in a cave  by the sea. In a film that begins in a neo-realist mode, Grazia's self-exile eventually takes  on a mythic dimension. — Stephen Holden","2003-03-28","","2017-11-02 04:16:20","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/28/movies/film-festival-review-one-woman-goes-for-a-swim-and-an-entire-village-takes-note.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of Respiro'}",NA

The movie feels more like a breezy, jazz-inflected version of the original: it's a triumph of flourish, with all weathered movie-star-size gestures. &quot;The Good Thief&quot; combines American flamboyance and French existentialist delirium. As played by Mr. Nolte, Bob is a brawny noir pin-up as trickster — an old dog who never lets on how many tricks he knows.  Mr. Jordan gives the proceedings a double-heist plot turn.

Tareque Masud's expansive fluidity is rapturous, inspired equally by the floating equanimity of Satyajit Ray and the work of the Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami, who deftly uses ritual behavior to provide social commentary. Set in Bangladesh in the 1960's, &quot;The Clay Bird&quot; questions the nature of dedication to Islam. It doesn't attack fealty but eventually rebukes zealotry by showing a boy's reaction to his father's recent total immersion.  Anu (Nurul Islam Bablu) is sent off to a religious school by his father, Kazi (Jayanto Chattopadhyay). Kazi doesn't want his son tainted by the outside world. His obedient though doubtful wife, Ayesha (Rokeya Prachy), quietly expresses through frowns her concern about Kazi's close-minded new seriousness. She gently reasons with her boy, and the bright Anu resigns himself to his new life.  Mr. Masud's sensitivity gives the film a pungent emotional clarity; he recognizes that naïveté isn't a province only of childhood. Kazi's a naïf, too, and learns the hard way that following a path without independent thought is a fool's errand. He's ultimately devastated when he learns of the civil war and Muslims attacking other Muslims: the revolution is coming, and it claims Kazi's way of life. &#151; Elvis Mitchell","2003-04-05","","2017-11-02 04:16:22","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/05/movies/film-festival-reviews-a-child-copes-with-dad-s-zealotry.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of The Clay Bird'}",NA

Two brothers, abandoned by their father, get into some minor trouble, after which their overwhelmed mother sends them to a local Islamic school.

Here, the large cast sends up the folk-music scene of the 1960's, some of whose fictitious leading lights — the lovey-dovey duo Mitch and Mickey, the hard-working Folksmen, and the appallingly upbeat New Main Street Singers — gather for a reunion at Town Hall in Manhattan. It has been noted that this trompe l'oeil satire ignores the political dimensions of American folk music, but Mr. Guest is so faithful to the world he has created that you can forgive any lapses with regard to the one that exists. Bad music has never sounded so good, and the film's deadpan sincerity — especially evident in Ms. O'Hara's performance as the disppointed Mickey — will make you clap your hands and sing along even as you are laughing your head off. — A.

The story is filtered through the sensibility of Agnes (Molly Parker), the restless  youngest sister and the family's black sheep who is in shaky recovery from alcohol and  cocaine addiction. The oldest, Theresa (Rebecca Jenkins), is a grim, long-suffering refugee  from a failed marriage; the middle sister, Louise (Stacy Smith), an undeclared lesbian. But  once the movie has laid out its characters and their histories, it doesn't know where to  take them, and its contrived confrontations take on a stagy clank.

The story — of a young boy (Shia LaBeouf) unjustly sent to a camp for delinquents — is intricate to the point of being hectic, but it is also surprising, moving and endlessly inventive as it bounces from present to past, from allegory to naturalism, from comedy to suspense. Along the way, its clear-eyed exploration of themes that range from the challenges of friendship to the legacy of American racism put most movies aimed at alleged grownups to shame. And grownups, even those who can't find a 10-year-old to take them along, should not be ashamed to seek out the best film released by a big American studio so far this year. — A. O.

The movie, whose few words, spoken the  director, are explanatory captions, offers a sweeping global tour from a bird's-eye view,  dressed up with a new-age score by Bruno Coulais. And as the images of flying birds  (along with the often harsh, seemingly urgent sounds of their cries) in perfect, swooping  formation accumulate, the film speaks wistfully to humankind's profound, residual  longing to soar through the heavens without mechanical help. On the negative side, the  information is so sketchy that at the end of the experience, you're left almost as much in  the dark as you were at the beginning. — Stephen Holden","2003-04-18","2003-08-29","2017-11-02 04:18:02","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/18/movies/film-review-a-beady-eyed-perspective-on-migrating-birds.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of Winged Migration'}",NA

The tale of this vulnerable, credulous teenager, who prays earnestly to a cheap painting of an angel cradling a child, is a variation on countless true stories that have come out of Eastern Europe since the fall of Communism. Lilya is tricked into a life of forced prostitution in another country (in this case, Sweden) by gangsters posing as prospective employers. The film's most remarkable achievement is its presentation of Lilya's story as both an archetypal case study and a personal drama whose spunky central character you  come to care about so deeply that at each step toward her ruination you want to cry out a  warning. — Stephen Holden","2003-04-18","","2017-11-02 04:16:21","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/18/movies/film-review-hopes-disintegrate-into-a-life-of-degradation.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of Lilya 4-Ever'}",NA

Four of those actors  — Kirk, Michael, Cameron and Diana Douglas — are actually related to one another by birth or by marriage and play fictionalized versions of themselves in the film, which deftly skips around among half a dozen major characters.

The children, whose various backgrounds form a rich, complex American patchwork, are as remarkable for their individuality as for their sociological diversity. Somehow the picture's themes — the peculiarity of the competitive spelling subculture, of its young adherents, and of the English language itself — add up to an unexpectedly rich and moving work of cultural insight and human sympathy.

The director has accentuated the ballet's racial and erotic  subtexts with a cartoonish audacity, portraying the count as a mysterious Eastern Other  spreading contamination into the West. As Zhang Wei-Qiang's suave, swashbuckling Dracula  seduces and poisons his victims, you think of Attila the Hun as a Valentino-like  voluptuary. For all its oddities, the movie, filmed mostly in Super 8, is surprisingly faithful to the 1897 Bram Stoker novel.

Instead he propels the picture forward with a documentary sureness. The movie might seem rather perfunctory if it weren't teeming with life; the last scene is a particularly lumpen cliché. This picture remains indelible because of Mr. Loach's bold, direct framing of the narrative, and the casual dynamism of its young star, Martin Compston, making his acting debut. This slim, gawky kid takes to the camera with alarming ease, and makes acting seem as deceptively simple as the title of Mr. Loach's involving film. The romance comes from the character's passions, which include fighting to stay alive and keeping a light in his heart for his jailed mother, Jean (Michelle Coulter). Mr. Compston succeeds on the same levels as the film, which brings to mind the socially conscious melodramas of the 1930's from Warner Brothers. Several scenes also evoke François Truffaut's 1959 triumph, &quot;The 400 Blows,&quot; with its adolescent sense of doom and reckless,  unfocused energy.

Essentially, that's what &quot;Capturing the Friedmans&quot; is all about, the American middle-class obsession of documenting innocuous daily life with eight-millimeter cameras and now videotape. Mr. Jarecki took film of a continuing tragedy and shrewdly wove the footage into a grim, watchable wormhole narrative about a family's decades-long tumble into a shattering pile of self-denial, lies and abuse. In the case of the Friedman family of Great Neck, on Long Island, the videotapes and eight-millimeter films say plenty. The amiable, deep bond between father and sons is tested when a child pornography scandal rocks their homes and lives. Mr. Jarceki so recognizes the archetypal figures in the Friedman home that he knows to push things any further through heavy-handed assessment would be redundant. This translates into an astonishing amount of confidence in his judgment. He layers the story, setting up his premise early in the film — that first impressions can't be trusted and that truth rests with each person telling the story. — Elvis Mitchell","2003-05-30","2003-07-18","2017-11-02 04:18:02","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/30/movies/film-review-witness-to-a-family-s-slow-motion-collapse.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of Capturing the Friedmans'}",NA

This terrifically smart and solid piece of filmmaking lets the former members of the Weathermen, now on the downside of their 50's, speak into the camera and reveal a bit of their personal histories as well as what the peace movement mean to them. The documentary is also packed with some of the most powerful images of violence of the period, like a bound Vietnamese being shot in the head at point-blank range and the bloody bed of the Black Panther Fred Hampton after he was killed. Voluble and charismatic, the film's stars  — the members of the group determined to overthrow what they considered to be a criminal United States government that waged the Vietnam War and targeted groups like the Black Panthers — spent a lot of time in the media spotlight; young, white and articulate, figures like Bernadette Dohrn, Bill Ayers, Mark Rudd, Brian Flanagan and Naomi Jaffe were clearly very sexy criminals. That exuberance and incentive has been captured by the directors. Sam Green and Bill Siegel have made a film of passions, and they establish a context that shows what a turbulent period the late 1960's were, slyly contrasting the peace-and-love vibe with events of the time.

It traces a hectic day in the life of a splintered Dominican family, whose pride and joy, Manny (Leo Minaya), is about to graduate from high school. Mr. Eason's ear for speech is as impressive as his eye for local detail, and the film manages to be at once intimate and tactful. Frankie G., who plays Manny's protective older brother, Junior, has some rough edges, but he shows himself to be a powerful actor with the ability to display the nuances of his character's contradictory temperament. In the end, the movie swerves toward melodrama — becoming a fable of The Streets rather than a story of particular blocks and boulevards — but for most of its packed, brief running time it is beautifully observed and full of life. — A.O.

Ian Ziv's &quot;Human Weapon,&quot; a cool, analytical, ultimately pessimistic history of suicide bombing as a form of warfare, finds an unsettling pattern in the way this technique has widened to encompass civilians as well  as military targets. The camera doesn't shy away from images of carnage. In &quot;My  Terrorist,&quot; Yulie Cohen Gerstel, a sixth-generation Israeli who was seriously injured during a  1978 attack on an El Al flight, seeks out Fahad Mihyi, one of the attackers who spent the  last 22 years isolated in an English prison.

"208",7,"28 Days Later","R",1,"A. O. Scott","Spared by a Virus but Not by Mankind","When it is not scaring you silly, this film invites you to reflect seriously on the fragility of modern civilization, which has been swept away, while the hero lies peacefully in a coma, by a gruesome and highly contagious virus. Four weeks after a laboratory full of rage-infected monkeys has been liberated by some tragically misguided animal-rights activists, the whole of London — and possibly every place else — has been substantially depopulated, leaving the few healthy survivors to contend with red-eyed, ravenous infecteds. The movie is suitably graphic and terrifying, but it also has some surprising pastoral moments, as the main characters flee London for the countryside. Anthony Dod Mantle's digital cinematography has an exquisite, painterly beauty that makes the picture not just scary, which it surely is, but genuinely haunting. In contemplating the extinction of the human race, Danny Boyle, director of such cynical, style-charged movies as &quot;Trainspotting&quot; and &quot;Shallow Grave,&quot; seems to have discovered his inner humanist. — A.

"209",8,"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl","PG-13",1,"Elvis Mitchell","Mascara as Black as a Jolly Roger","This film floats one of the least posed and, therefore, most important  cinematic questions of our time: Can a movie maintain the dramatic integrity of a theme-park ride? In the case of Gore Verbinski's film, the answer is sure. Mr. Verbinski's penchant for logistics combined with the producer Jerry Bruckheimer's desire to spend like a drunken pirate when it comes to putting everything onscreen melt into an often frenetic, colorful and entertaining comic adventure. The dazzling, high-flying silliness is quite an achievement:  the movie is better than it deserves to be, given its origins. In fact, there's enough storyline for several movies. The wiry and beauteous tomboy Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) owns a medallion that gets the plot going roughly a scant hour into &quot;Pirates.&quot; The pirate Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) kidnaps Elizabeth because of the medallion, which turns out to be an enchanted piece of gold that can free Barbossa and his swabbies from their curse. They're the larcenous undead whose skeletons can be seen in the moonlight. But the movie belongs to Johnny Depp as the pirate Capt. Jack Sparrow. Gargling his consonants before spitting them out, Mr. Depp suggests a man who has spent either a great deal of time with Keith Richards after a tour of the Rebel Yell factory, or a man who has spent a great deal of time watching Mike Myers do his Keith Richards impression. — Elvis Mitchell","2003-07-09","2003-07-09","2017-11-02 04:18:02","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/09/movies/film-review-mascara-as-black-as-a-jolly-roger.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl'}",NA

His feverish act, driven by the sizzle of samba, is a glittering, sweat-drenched celebration of the body with  songs and stories that match the wildest inventions of Scheherezade. We meet  Francisco's extended family (a prostitute, her baby and their live-in slave) and one of his  lovers. Fueled by Lázaro Ramos's incandescent performance, the movie creates a romantic  vision of a bygone urban demimonde with many resemblances to Jean Genet's Parisian  underworld. — Stephen Holden","2003-07-09","","2017-11-02 04:16:22","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/09/movies/film-review-an-outcast-on-fire-in-rio-s-underworld.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of Madame Sata'}",NA
"211",10,"Dirty Pretty Things","R",1,"Elvis Mitchell","Amid the Luxury, Immigrants in Peril","This swift, tangy drama, with a terrifically terse title, pits London's illegal immigrants against the alluring hope of propriety. They are a forgotten population struggling to bring in enough income so that they don't become disposable. They're expendable manpower in the war to man the desks, mops and bottom-drawer duties of the behind-the-scenes world of luxury hotels, where they're unnoticed by the public, and underpaid and overworked by their employers. This is an urban-legend horror story rendered with grim intelligence by the man with the right tools for the job: Stephen Frears. This understated and sure film is set in a world of survivors. One of them, the Nigerian Okwe (Chiwetel Ejiofor) — who drives a cab and also works as a hotel porter under the large thumb of the smooth operator night manager, Sneaky, a smooth operator (Sergi Lopez) — seems to be as haunted as he is obsessed. The film doesn't elaborate on the troubles that have sent Okwe so far from home; all we really know is that he has left a wife and a daughter behind, and part of his pain comes from pining for them. That lingering misery is what keeps him safely on the couch of his Turkish roommate, the virginal Senay (Audrey Tatou), refusing to act on the magnetism that keeps her gazing at him adoringly. He's capable of loyalty to the rest of his ad hoc family —  to Guo Yi (Benedict Wong), the mortuary attendant, and the dangerously close-to-cliché, lovable hooker (Sophie Okonedo). The actress's cleverness brings shading and warmth to an otherwise stereotyped part. &quot;Dirty Pretty Things&quot; suggests a demented sequel to Paul Mazursky's &quot;Moscow on the Hudson,&quot; a dog-eared fairy tale in which industry and hard work could deliver refugees from evil, or at least into the middle classes. In &quot;Things,&quot; diligence is not its own reward — the decent have to fight the treacherous undertow of their employers as well as the opportunistic immigration agents. — Elvis Mitchell","2003-07-18","2003-09-05","2017-11-02 04:18:02","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/18/movies/film-review-amid-the-luxury-immigrants-in-peril.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of Dirty Pretty Things'}",NA
"212",11,"Johnny English","PG",1,"A. O. Scott","A Bumbling British Spy, Both Shaken and Stirred","Splendid silliness from Rowan Atkinson, who combines the verbal dexterity of his Blackadder persona with the hapless slapstick of Mr. Bean. His character, a would-be superspy, must save England from an evil French gazillionaire, played with exquisite ennui by John Malkovich. Unlike the Austin Powers movies, whose humor depends on sexual innuendo and pop-culture reference-mongering, Johnny English taps an older, simpler reservoir of comic possibilities. Silly walks, funny faces, ridiculous sight gags, the naked buttocks of the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the contents of sewer pipes. Not to worry, though. As Johnny himself remarks, it's only a bit of poo. — A. O.

"213",12,"Freaky Friday","PG",1,"A. O. Scott","Walking in Mom's Shoes With Mom's Feet, Too","This new adaptation of Mary Rodgers's beloved novel (also the source of a 1976 movie starring Jodie Foster) is a brisk, inventive comedy of generational misunderstanding and mother-daughter reconciliation. Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis are Anna and Tess Coleman, who wake up one morning to find that they have switched bodies. The mother must navigate the social minefield of high school, while the daughter is plunged into a frenzy of multi-tasking, juggling work, parenthood and an impending remarriage (to an upstanding fellow played by Mark Harmon). The measure of the film's integrity is how smoothly it modulates from wild farce to earnest sentiment, and the two — really the four — main performances are as dazzling as they are effortless. This is especially true of Ms. Curtis, a real-life mom (and best-selling children's-book author in her own right), whose impersonation of a teenager trapped in a middle-aged body is wild, witty and breathtakingly funny. — A.O.

"214",13,"American Splendor","",1,"Elvis Mitchell","A Comics Guy, Outside the Box","&quot;From off the streets of Cleveland comes 'American Splendor,' &quot; screams the cover of every issue of the writer Harvey Pekar's surly and open-eyed autobiographical comic series. The towering, action-packed logo is a further sardonic comment on the lack of activity in the protagonist's life. There's as much at stake in this hilarious, moody and cantankerous film adaptation of &quot;Splendor&quot; as there was in this summer's other movies of comics anti-heroes like &quot;The Hulk&quot; and &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.&quot; Harvey is extraordinary — by the way, so is this movie. As played by Paul Giamatti, Harvey's a gray wad of anger that spends his time in his cave-like apartment, with shelves sagging under the weight of his collection of record albums and jazz 78's. And sputtering to his equally powerless pals about a world that he refuses to understand. Slumped into a posture that's a question mark with a pot-belly, Mr. Giamatti's a frustrated tremor, shaking and gesticulating futilely. The filmmakers use the real Mr. Pekar as a narrator initially. For a time, the film cuts to the real-life Pekar, fulminating onscreen with his friends against a stark-white background. This sounds like a mocking, distancing device — and in the wrong hands, it would be. But the real-life Pekar is as vivid in his way as Mr. Giamatti. The actual Pekaris a flinty crank spouting while the actors portraying figures from the streets of Cleveland chuckle in disbelief at him and his obsessive, nerdy friends, like Toby (played in the film with breath-taking precision by Judah Friedlander). The great cast also includes Earl Billings as Mr. Boats, one of Harvey bellicose, small-minded and larger-than-life co-workers, and Danny Hoch. Harvey's romantic match, Joyce Brabner, is played with a tart, intriguing directness by Hope Davis that's equal parts Emma Goldman and Olive Oyl —  that is, the Olive Oyl of the comics, not the screaming helpless No. 2 pencil of the cartoons. And the picture becomes something richer and fuller when Joyce enters the film. Harvey has someone to square off with, and her eccentricities complement his. — Elvis Mitchell","2003-08-15","2003-09-12","2017-11-02 04:18:02","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/15/movies/film-review-a-comics-guy-outside-the-box.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of American Splendor'}",NA
"215",14,"Thirteen","R",1,"Elvis Mitchell","Trading Barbie for Drugs, Sex and Halter Tops","The panic in the eyes of Tracy (Evan Rachel Wood), the barely teenaged protagonist of &quot;Thirteen,&quot; will stay with you for a very long time. &quot;Thirteen&quot; treats Tracy's behavior as a fever dream, something viral. This disease eating up her empathy and decency is what she picked up from the effortlessly cool Evie (Nikki Reed), who crashes into Tracy's life and plucks her from an existence of age-appropriate fixations like Barbie dolls. Evie, with the physical confidence of a much older girl, knows exactly how to devastate Tracy; she breezily drops hints that she thinks her new friend is immature. As Evie takes Tracy under her broken wing to remake her, we feel we're watching the protagonist of &quot;Thirteen&quot; undergo the initiations of a new tribe.  The closest  the film comes to a narrative is in following its young central figure straying into sex, drugs and alienation and her sudden detachment from her struggling single mother, Melanie (Holly  Hunter). What we recognize from the stricken look in Melanie's face is the same panic in Tracy's eyes — it's something mother and daughter share, and Ms. Hunter wills this spiritual match-up into existence. The movie has the ebb and flow that comes from material structured as a series of anecdotes —  it doesn't build, and sometimes it feels as cluttered as a 13-year-old's bedroom. But that may be a byproduct of Catherine Hardwicke's attempt to layer incidents that are as far as possible from the weary set of clichés that inform pictures about teens. Ms. Hardwicke, making her directorial debut, works from a screenplay she authored with Ms. Reed, shaped around autobiographical elements from the actress's own life. Usually, the protagonist is the bystander — in &quot;Thirteen,&quot; she's the fuse. — Elvis Mitchell","2003-08-20","2003-09-19","2017-11-02 04:18:02","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/20/movies/film-review-trading-barbie-for-drugs-sex-and-halter-tops.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of Thirteen'}",NA
"216",15,"Once Upon a Time In the Midlands","R",1,"Elvis Mitchell","Can a Nice Guy Beat a Bad Boy?","The subject matter of the British director Shane Meadows's &quot;Midlands&quot; is a wry counterpoint to the film's sprawling, epic title. The movie is a soulful domestic comedy with more in common with the enchantingly freakish twitches of life found in a Bill Forsyth film like &quot;Local Hero&quot; than one of Sergio Leone's blood-orange epics like &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West.&quot;  &quot;Midlands&quot; weaves a large number of characters throughout the tract homes of Nottingham, where the movie is set. It threatens a showdown  between a pair of rivals, Dek (Rhys Ifans) and Jimmy (Robert Carlyle), who both want Shirley (Shirley Henderson). And by the end of the film, Mr. Meadows exaggerates the conventions of the western to make his own points about the foolishness of machismo.  But what really separates &quot;Midlands&quot; from Leone's desiccated, terse genre work is Mr. Meadows's doting attention over his characters' decency. It gives a demonstrative bittersweetness to a likable but small story. Jimmy strides into Shirley's life to reclaim her and their daughter, Marlene (Finn Atkins), though he's been out of the picture for so long that there could have been a reality show about his disappearance. It's an actual reality show that has caused the trouble for Dek; he proposed to Shirley, with whom he's been living and helping to raise her little girl, and she rebuffed him on national television. Stunned, he's picking up the shards of what used to be his dignity when Jimmy returns, further tangling the knot of emotional complications. &quot;Midlands&quot; is primarily a film about the need that fatherhood fills — Dek's closeness to Marlene registers strongly. — Elvis Mitchell","2003-08-29","","2017-11-02 04:16:21","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/29/movies/film-review-can-a-nice-guy-beat-a-bad-boy.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of Once Upon a Time In the Midlands'}",NA
"217",16,"Carnage","Not Rated",1,"A. O. Scott","A Bull, After Death, Touches Many Unrelated Lives","An elegant, elliptical meditation on death, sex, meat and desire. There is violence, and a subdued erotic throb, but the movie's pleasures are more cerebral than sensual. A group of far-flung, mostly lonely Europeans, including an actress (Chiara Mastrantonio), a taxidermist (Bernard Sens), a research scientist (Jacques Gamblin) and a five-year old girl with epilepsy (Raphaelle Molinier) are linked together by chance and coincidence. Specifically, they each come into contact with parts of a Spanish bull, who has gored a young matador and subsequently been slaughtered. The animal, whose name is Romero, produces not only meat, but metaphor as well; his death opens up a philosophical inquiry that is ambitious and sometimes rather vague. What makes &quot;Carnage&quot; fascinating, though, is less the scale of Delphine Gleize's intellectual passions than the precision and originality of her cinematic style. This movie, her first feature, is both lyrical and tough-minded, and her ability to embed ideas in visual compositions is as subtle as it is extraordinary. — A. O.

Of the five, only one  remained an outdoorsman.. The other four are solid citizens, married or divorced, with  children and leading complicated but reasonably happy grown-up lives.

"219",18,"Lost In Translation","R",1,"Elvis Mitchell","An American in Japan, Making a Connection","Sofia Coppola's comic melodrama thoroughly and touchingly bridges the yawning gap between three standards of yearning in movies: David Lean's &quot;Brief Encounter,&quot; Richard Linklater's &quot;Before Sunrise&quot; and Wong Kar-wai's &quot;In the Mood for Love.&quot; The movie happens to be hilarious — a paean to dislocated people discovering how alive they are when they can barely keep their eyes open. The sexiness comes from the busy, desperate need-to-impress heat of a flirtation, an unrequited love communicated through a filter of sleep deprivation. &quot;Translation&quot; is also one of the purest and simplest examples ever of a director's falling in love with her star's gifts. And never has a director found a figure more deserving of her admiration than Bill Murray. He plays a vodka-and-bitters version of himself, and the persona that made him famous. His character, Bob, is an American movie star who's in Tokyo to participate in the celebrity not-so-secret shame: picking up a boatload of dough to appear in commercials for Suntory whiskey. While blinking sleeplessly around the hotel lobby of the majestically hermetic Tokyo Hyatt, he meets Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), who has been abandoned by her husband, an ambitious photographer; he's off shooting a band. The movie follows the twists and connections in Bob and Charlotte's relationship; like some trans-Atlantic phone calls, their feelings reach each other on a five-second delay. The lag time only adds to the comedy, and heartbreak. — Elvis Mitchell","2003-09-12","2003-10-03","2017-11-02 04:18:02","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/12/movies/film-review-an-american-in-japan-making-a-connection.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of Lost In Translation'}",NA
"220",19,"Millennium Actress","PG",1,"A. O.

In this case the immediate object is Chiyoko Fujihara, a legendary (and fictitious) Japanese movie star whose retirement is interrupted by an ardent documentary maker. Chiyoko's reminiscences of her adventures on and off screen before and after World War II become a fantastic, gorgeously romantic voyage through the history of Japanese cinema in its golden age. Satoshi Koh pays tribute to the samurai epics, Godzilla movies and domestic urban dramas that were so central to that history, and he uses the freedom of animation to construct a seamless dream world in which real life and its representation in movies blend together in a single sweeping, intricate story. To some extent, the movie depends on familiarity with the cinematic and cultural traditions it celebrates, but its central emotions — the longing, worshipful fascination that the great vanished stars inspired in their fans — will be immediately accessible to anyone who has ever been seduced by the idea that life on screen can be not just more beautiful than real life, but more real. — A.

Shot in digital video with non-professional actors, it has a harsh immediacy that forces you to confront the terrible plight of the world's displaced people one face at a time. But this story of peril, frustration and heartbreak also has moments of great warmth and vitality. Jamal (Jamal Udin Torabi), the younger of the two travelers, has a tough, impish joie de vivre, and as he and his cousin make their way west, they encounter decency as well as indifference.

If some of the jigsaw pieces in this beautifully acted movie are too fragmentary and crowded together, its even-handed view of two cultures uneasily transacting the most personal business resonates with truth. The movie adheres to the essayistic format of Mr. Sayles's earlier movies, and its attitude is rooted in the director's understanding of the degree to which the money, class and ethnicity determine our points of view. — Stephen Holden","2003-09-19","","2017-11-02 04:16:21","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/19/movies/film-review-six-characters-in-search-of-an-infant.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of Casa de Los Babys'}",NA

Its enigmatic antiheroine (Connie Nielsen) is an industrial spy who suggests a female cyber-age equivalent of the archetypal Man With No Name. The movie plays head games as relentlessly as she pursues espionage and clashes with other corporate spies, played by Gina Gershon and Chloe Sevigny.

"227",6,"The Station Agent","R",1,"Elvis Mitchell","A Train Depot, More Dream Than Destination","The remote outpost that a dwarf named Fin (Peter Dinklage) settles into, a rundown train depot in the wilds of New Jersey, is such a restful space that it seems perfect for him. Tom McCarthy has such an appreciation for quiet that it occupies the same space as a character in this film, a delicate, thoughtful and often hilarious take on loneliness.  Fin, with his low, rational voice and intense stare, has moved into the small spot after he inherits it. Mr. McCarthy treats Fin's new life as if his protagonist were emerging from underwater and must adjust to the onrush of aural assault. Much of it comes from Joe (Bobby Cannavale), the relentlessly friendly and talky Cuban who pulls up every day in his food truck to run what must be the loneliest retail location not staffed by a Maytag salesman. Hawking coffee and fanning up a cloud of busy, pushy and likable chatter, Joe elbows his way into the taciturn Fin's life. Mr. McCarthy wrings contrasts from the serene, diminutive Mr. Dinklage — whose dignity seems unassailable until finally ruffled, when he lets loose a thunderbolt of hostility — and the big, buffed Cannavale, whose unremitting volubility is sheer charm. Their relationship is goofily enthralling. A movie about a dwarf certainly flirts with being cringe-worthy, at least in the abstract, but Mr. McCarthy deals with his creations as characters. What's most important about Fin is the detachment he imposes on himself — his resignation with loneliness. — Elvis Mitchell","2003-10-03","2003-12-05","2017-11-02 04:18:03","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/03/movies/film-review-a-train-depot-more-dream-than-destination.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of The Station Agent'}",NA

Mr. Black's incandescent comic energy should establish him as the screen's most popular rock-fueled  wild man since John Belushi. Under the nose of the prim school principal (Joan Cusack),  Dewey, who knows nothing of academics, preaches the gospel of rock 'n' roll and secretly  converts the class from liking Christine Aguilera songs and the musical &quot;Annie&quot; to appreciating Led Zeppelin and  AC/DC. This family-friendly movie, which has big rousing &quot;Rocky&quot;-style finale and isn't  believable for a second, is a hilarious cotton-candy fantasy with a beat.

Scott","Dark Parable of Violence Avenged","Clint Eastwood's film, scrupulously faithful to the letter and sprit of Dennis Lehane's novel, has the gritty efficiency of superior crime fiction and the somber weight of tragedy. Set in working-class Irish Catholic Boston, this film revisits the themes of violence, honor and guilt that have haunted many of Mr. Eastwood's movies; it is among the most humane of his films, but also the most rigorously pessimistic. Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon and Sean Penn play Dave, Sean and Jimmy, boyhood friends who must revisit the traumas of their youth when Jimmy's daughter is murdered. Sean and his partner (Laurence Fishburne) must investigate the killing, which it appears Dave may have committed. The performances are first rate. Marcia Gay Harden, as Dave's wife, Celeste, and Laura Linney, as her cousin Annabeth, who is married to Jimmy, expand the film's emotional compass, allowing us to see how grief ripples through families and communities. Mr. Penn's volcanic, furiously disciplined performance is surely one of the best pieces of screen acting you'll see this year; it may even be one of the finest ever. — A. O.

"230",9,"S21: The Khmer Rouge Killing Machine","Not Rated",1,"Elvis Mitchell","Survivor of Cambodian Prison Confronts a Nation's Madness","&quot;I survived because they liked my paintings,&quot; says Vann Nath in this unsettling documentary, an affecting and effective film. This placid artist was imprisoned along with 17,000 other Cambodians in a Phnom Penh high school that had been converted into a Khmer Rouge interrogation and torture center. The school was used for this purpose for two years during the Khmer Rouge reign of terror (1975 to 1979), when as many as a million people died. In the film, he returns there to confront the men who worked as guards, really boys doing the Devil's work: at the time, they ranged from 13 to their early 20's. At one point the director shows the former guards recreating their grisly everyday tasks as a kind of pantomime. Watching them re-enact their chores in the large, stained and now empty rooms, which look like those in almost any American high school — while piles of the dead prisoners' abandoned clothes sit heaped nearby — is simply one of the most disorienting moments you're likely to encounter in a movie. — Elvis Mitchell","2003-10-04","","2017-11-02 04:16:23","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/04/movies/film-festival-review-an-artist-s-stark-vision-of-cambodian-slaughter.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of S21: The Khmer Rouge Killing Machine'}",NA
"231",10,"Dogville","R",1,"Stephen Holden","Virtue Is Its Own Punishment","The quasi-Christian allegory by the Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier is certain to divide audiences into passionate champions and hissing naysayers. Mr. von Trier is a ruthless provocateur with the sensibility of a practical joker. The ensemble drama, filmed on a stage designed as a map, often suggests a long-winded Brechtian deconstruction of &quot;Our Town.&quot; As a  contemptuous, nose-thumbing expression of the director's misanthropy, especially his  anti-Americanism, the movie is relentlessly true to its hateful vision, which portrays the  ideal of embracing human community (and especially the cozy, cookie-baking dream of  small-town America) as a lie. The only true solidarity to be found in any group, it  proposes, is in xenophobic mob violence. Set during the Depression in the imaginary American town of Dogville, it reworks Mr. von Trier's favorite metaphor for human cruelty — the persecution and martyrdom of an innocent young woman (played by Ms. Kidman) — then subjects it to a transcendently nasty, vengeful twist. — Stephen Holden","2003-10-04","2004-04-23","2017-11-02 04:18:03","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/04/movies/film-festival-review-virtue-is-its-own-punishment.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of Dogville'}",NA
"232",11,"Elephant","R",1,"Elvis Mitchell","A 'Normal' High School on the Verge","This unusual and remarkable film has a premise so simple that, in the abstract, it borders on the banal: plotless and stubbornly resistant to conventional narrative structure, the movie has its camera follow students around the halls and grounds of a  high school in Portland, Ore., for a day until violence  erupts.  &quot;Elephant&quot; is the director Gus Van Sant's take on the murders that took place at Columbine High School.  The title comes from the British director Alan Clarke's 1989 rough-and-ready short film of the same name, a tough and dense look at the   violence in northern Ireland, which also didn't paste answers onto the  problem. Mr. Clarke's short outraged or absorbed viewers in the way Mr. Van  Sant's movie, which won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, is likely to do. (Mr. Clarke's title referred to the aphorism about the elephant in the living room — a problem that people refuse to face for so long that they are no longer even able to  see it.) &quot;Elephant&quot; will confound audiences looking for solutions or villains, because it doesn't supply them. There's no narrator perched  omnisciently over the events, nor the kinds of exaggerated melodramatics  and pop music that teen movies employ to insistently nag at emotions. There are few recognizable actors, since Mr. Van Sant populated the movie with   kids who had never acted before, heightening the realism and the tension. Mr. Van Sant gives &quot;Elephant&quot; a Spartan yet elusive life by shifting the film's focus from one group of  students to another; the camera actually drifts like a bored high school student.  And by the end of the movie, we realize where much of the power and clarity of the film comes  from. By making the camera an observer, we get a perspective  that often comes out of horror movies, a choice that whips the ordinary  with the terrifying —  an unforgettable mix. — Elvis Mitchell","2003-10-10","2003-11-14","2017-11-02 04:18:03","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/10/movies/film-festival-review-normal-high-school-on-the-verge.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of Elephant'}",NA
"233",12,"Intolerable Cruelty","PG-13",1,"Elvis Mitchell","A Lawyer's Good Teeth Help in Court and Love","This Coen Brothers film is something not seen in movie theaters for a long time: an intelligent, modern screwball comedy, a minor classic on the order of the competent, fast-talking curveballs about deception and greed like Mitchell Leisen's &quot;Easy Living&quot; and Billy Wilder's &quot;Major and the Minor.&quot; &quot;Cruelty&quot; shares something with comedic entries in the Coen canon like &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; and &quot;Raising Arizona&quot;: a full-blooded movie star performance to put it squarely into the strike zone. This time the good work comes from George Clooney. His gift of gab is perfectly suited for Miles, the crème de la crème of divorce lawyers. Miles has everything but a soul, though he doesn't actually look as if he'd require one. And the babe he falls for isn't exactly the person to give him one either. Marilyn (Catherine  Zeta-Jones), as delectable as a white-chocolate Easter Bunny, has been tagged for a vicious divorce by her husband, a serial adulterer, after she catches him cheating. Her uptown-girl beauty and silken opacity make her the kind of trophy Miles would want to win. And when she jabs a No. 2 pencil into Miles's heart by showing up with her beau, a Texas millionaire (Billy Bob Thornton), Miles is horrified, but not defeated. That's what makes the picture work so beautifully; it is a film about underhanded professionals by filmmakers who delight in the epitome of criminal enterprise. — Elvis Mitchell","2003-10-10","2003-10-10","2017-11-02 04:18:02","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/10/movies/film-review-a-lawyer-s-good-teeth-help-in-court-and-love.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of Intolerable Cruelty'}",NA

Birth, death, illness, family and social history, childhood and old age, moviemaking, geography and commerce are among the topics Ross McElwee weaves into a dense but surprisingly orderly bundle of information, memory and conjecture.  The quest he undertakes in &quot;Bright Leaves&quot; is rooted in his own family background. His great-grandfather was a tobacco king who created the brand known as &quot;Bull Durham.&quot; As a photographer, he has a knack for studying a weather-beaten face and instantly discovering the soul inside. Whether he's recording a family gathering, contemplating the beauty of the coastline and his young son happily frolicking in the surf, or surveying a tobacco field, Mr. McElwee conveys a sensuous appreciation of life. Mr. McElwee, who has made seven feature-length documentaries, is really an American humorist in a tradition that extends from Mark Twain through Garrison Keillor. — Stephen Holden","2003-10-11","","2017-11-02 04:16:23","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/11/movies/film-festival-review-tapestry-of-a-family-and-its-home-state.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of Bright Leaves'}",NA

McNamara. Mr. McNamara, who was 85 when the interviews that make up the bulk of the film were conducted two years ago, served under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson in the 1960's  and has been widely vilified as a major architect of the Vietnam war. Subtitled &quot;Eleven Lessons of Robert S. McNamara,&quot; the movie organizes his hard-won observations into a  list of maxims about war and human error whose cumulative message suggests that  during wartime nobody really knows anything. The film, which has a solemn, anxious  score by Philip Glass, incorporates White House tapes of conversations about Vietnam  that Mr. McNamara had with both Presidents, along with vintage clips from World War II and Vietnam. — Stephen Holden","2003-10-11","2004-03-05","2017-11-02 04:18:03","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/11/movies/film-festival-review-revisiting-mcnamara-and-the-war-he-headed.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of The Fog of War'}",NA

The answer is not altogether surprising, and at times &quot;Crimson Gold&quot; exhibits a finger-pointing didacticism as it exposes the cruelties and inequities of a society sharply polarized by class and corrupted by selfishness, snobbery and cynicism. But the occasional obviousness of the film s themes is more than balanced by the subtlety of its methods, and by the stolid, irreducible individuality of Mr. Emadeddin, a non-professional actor whose thick, impassive countenance charts Hussein's progress from weary irony to violent despair. — A.

Otar, a medical student from the former Soviet  republic of Georgia, has fled the bleak, crumbling city of Tblisi, where he grew up, to live  in Paris where he is struggling to make his way without a visa. Left behind are his doting  mother (Esther Gorintin), his sister (Nino  Khomassouridze) and his sister's daughter (Dinara  Droukarova). Like Chekhov's &quot;Three Sisters,&quot; &quot;Since Otar Left&quot; is about yearning as a  life force. The mother, a painfully stooped, hobbling old woman, lives for her son's  occasional phone calls and letters. When word comes that Otar has died in a construction  accident, the sister and granddaughter, afraid to break the news, put on a charade, writing   bogus letters that spur the mother to journey to Paris to see her son.

This time, the bawdy talk and political banter is shadowed by mortality, and by the rueful awareness that history has had the last laugh. Rémy (Rémy Girard) is dying of cancer, and friends, former lovers and his estranged wife gather around his death bed for a long, sentimental seminar replete with naughty jokes and wistful nostalgia. Joining them are two members of the younger generation, Rémy's son, Sébastien (Stéphane Rousseau), a wealthy international banker, and Nathalie (Marie-Josée Crozee), a heroin addict, who lack both the bravado and the narcissism of their parents. What makes this more than a facile study in generational conflict is Mr. Arcand's acute sense of history: he has made the cultural contradictions of global capitalism into the material of a heartfelt domestic drama that is also a broad, accessible and devilishly funny sex farce. — A.

Christine Jeff's film is relatively even-handed in its treatment of Hughes (Daniel Craig) and turns its subject from a case study in literary pathology into the heroine of a modern literary opera. The film, shot in dark, over-saturated colors by John Toon, is itself oversaturated with feeling. Rather than try to explain Plath s death, or probe the roots of her poetry, Ms. Jeffs and Gwenyth Paltrow burrow deep into her personality, leaving its essential, unsettling mysteries intact. Ms. Paltrow is a vivid, passionate presence throughout the film — she is rarely off the screen — and she charts the jagged course of Plath's abbreviated adulthood with ardor and intelligence. The movie turns biography into melodrama, but it does so out of a fierce, fascinated loyalty to Plath, who after all did much the same thing in her best poems. — A. O.

"241",0,"21 Grams","R",1,"Elvis Mitchell","Hearts Incapacitated, Souls Wasting Away","This melodrama by the Mexican director Alejandro González Iñárritu is a ruminative, stunned look at life after death — that is, the existence of the living after they have been devastated by loss. It's the aftermath. The actors playing the characters who have been rocked by catastrophe don't sink to theatrical histrionics; instead they're linked by the red-eyed, unblinking stare of zombies, and they shamble through their day-by-day activities as if saddled with death wishes they are too enervated to act upon. This is American Existentialism. The stars achieve something that doesn't sound as if it's possible: a virtuosity in the depiction of people wasting away minute by minute. Be prepared for it. You won't come out unaffected, because the depths of intimacy that the director plumbs here are so rarely touched by filmmakers that &quot;21 Grams&quot; is tantamount to the discovery of a new country. Prof. Paul Rivers (Sean Penn) is suffering from a damaged heart, which is about to give out on him, and the transplant he receives so consumes him with guilt that he's like a death-row prisoner with a horrible secret who's been pardoned. He still believes he deserves to die. Cristina (Naomi Watts), a reformed party girl, has returned to her fallen ways after taking up with Paul. She's lost her family in an auto accident. And Jack (Benicio Del Toro) is a shaggy, trembling mountain of anger he can barely contain. His already tenuous grasp on sobriety is slipping away even faster since being involved in a terrible incident. Working with the screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga and the bewilderingly versatile cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto — the team he assembled for his debut feature, &quot;Amores Perros&quot; — Mr. González Iñárritu once again deals with three scenarios connected by one far-reaching cataclysm. It's too early to call it a crowning work of a career — this is only his second film — but it may well be the crowning work of this year. — Elvis Mitchell","2003-10-18","2004-01-16","2017-11-02 04:18:03","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/18/movies/film-festival-review-hearts-incapacitated-souls-wasting-away.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of 21 Grams'}",NA
"242",1,"Morning Sun","",1,"Elvis Mitchell","The Loss of Relationships Under Mao's Rough Revolutionary Hand","This documentary does a thoughtful job of streamlining the bloody realities —  both literal and psychological —  of China's Cultural Revolution into roughly two hours of film. The movie begins with clips from a 1964 musical extravaganza,  as the narrator Margot Adler puts it, called &quot;The East Is Red.&quot; &quot;Red,&quot; photographed in volcanic color, splashes its rhetoric in terms so simple that the scenes almost become Brechtian — more specifically, it's a crude musical essentially produced by Mao, the Arthur Freed of Communism. The pieces of this musical shown in &quot;Morning Sun&quot; are so fulsomely straightforward that being denied a chance to see it in its entirety feels like a form of deprivation. That is, until the directors focus on the adults who were indoctrinated under the firm, unambiguous hand of Mao. Then deprivation is defined in truly horrific terms. One of the grown-ups describes the Revolution in grimly elegant fashion: &quot;It was an age ruled by both the poet and the executioner; poets scattered roses everywhere, while the executioner cast a long shadow of terror.&quot;  It was a force that, as &quot;Sun&quot; reminds us, molded a new generation into killers without any sense of the long and tortured history of a China that existed before Mao brutally eliminated all traces of it. One of the few subtle points of &quot;Sun&quot; is that even simple, lurid tragedy looks different to its admirers as people mature. The eloquence of the interview subjects  and the clips have a power that the written narration, which often sounds like an &quot;All Things Considered&quot; segment, often lacks. &quot;Chairman Mao said, 'You young people are like the Morning Sun; our hope is placed on you,' &quot; remembers Li Nanyang, who was a child of 1960's China. And, as &quot;Sun&quot; unfolds, she's shown to be one of the Cultural Revolution's victims. Her father, Li Rui, who rose through the ranks to become Mao's secretary, made the mistake of criticizing a failing policy during the Great Leap Forward, when farms were converted into small factories and the resultant shortages nearly crippled the nation. His reward was being publicly repudiated and sent away. His then 9-year-old daughter was ridiculed until she denounced him. &quot;Sun&quot; ends with a reunion of father and daughter, brought together again after 11 years. — Elvis Mitchell","2003-10-22","","2017-11-02 04:16:23","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/22/movies/film-review-the-loss-of-relationships-under-mao-s-rough-revolutionary-hand.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of Morning Sun'}",NA

Scott","A Young Writer's Ambition, With Loyalty and Betrayal","The story of Stephen Glass, a brilliant young journalist at the New Republic who turned out to be a profligate fabricator, might have inspired a dishy, cynical exposé of the insular, cut-throat world of magazine journalism. Instead, Billy Ray relates Glass's downfall with minimal embellishment and turns a tawdry anecdote into a sober, curiously thrilling examination of moral recklessness and office intrigue. What starts out as a sharp workplace comedy gradually darkens into a kind of managerial film noir as Glass (played with a perfect mixture of creepiness and charm by Hayden Christensen) is pursued by Charles Lane (Peter Sarsgaard), the magazine's editor and, in this version at least, the savior of its honor. With considerable ingenuity and wit, the movie's center of gravity shifts from Glass to Lane, and its ideas — about workplace loyalty, journalistic ethics, and the line between ambition and pathology — are all the more forceful for being delivered in a whisper. — A.

More than a scary close-up look at the raw mechanics of a right-wing coup which took place in April, 2002, the film is a cautionary examination of the use of television to deceive and manipulate the public.

"245",4,"In My Skin","Not Rated",1,"Stephen Holden","Desperately Trying to Relate to Her Body by Cutting It","This harrowing portrait of a thirty-something business woman who succumbs to an obsession with cutting her own flesh suggests that such extreme behavior is often a  desperate attempt to re-establish a connection with the body that has been lost. Esther  (Marina de Van), the central character, finds herself on the fast track to disaster after she injures a leg while stumbling around a junk-strewn building site in the dark. She develops an intoxicated, almost cannibalistic fascination with her own torn flesh and ability to  ignore physical pain. Because the camera shares her voyeuristic fascination with her skin, the movie is often uncomfortable to watch.

"246",5,"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World","PG-13",1,"A. O. Scott","Master of the Sea (and the French)","This stupendously entertaining movie, adapted from two of the novels in Patrick O'Brian's 20-volume maritime adventure series, celebrates an idea of England that might have seemed a bit corny even in 1805, when the action takes place, but that is brought to vibrant life thanks to Russell Crowe's commanding performance and Peter Weir's thoroughgoing mastery. Mr. Crowe plays Jack Aubrey, captain of the H.M.S. Surprise, a British frigate doing battle with a mysterious French battle ship off the Coast of South America. The combat scenes are shot with economy and vigor, but the most thrilling parts of the movie take place between skirmishes, when the complex system of authority and deference that runs the Surprise —  and the personality traits needed to keep it running —  is at the center of attention. The film's theme is the nature of authority, and Aubrey functions as a kind of ideal CEO: charismatic, tactically astute and able to instill in his sailors a sense of discipline and respect. Paul Bettany plays the ship's surgeon, Aubrey's best friend and foil, and the tension between them — between reason and duty, between intellect and action — gives the movie some unexpected dramatic depth. — A.

The core of the movie follows the heroic attempt by Alix's neighbor Digna  (Michael Hyatt), a successful young photographer and herself a recovering addict, to rescue her. For all the misery on view, the movie doesn't belong to the shock school of  addiction films represented by &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; or &quot;Spun,&quot; which concentrated on  sensations rather than characters.

"249",8,"Bad Santa","R",1,"Elvis Mitchell","This Santa Sobers Up, but Only for Greed","Somebody needed to make a comedy built around all of the holiday season hostility that goes up along with the decorations this time of year. The light-fingered director Terry Zwigoff and the screenwriters Glenn Ficarra and John Requa are just the guys for such a task. &quot;Bad Santa&quot; takes all of the Christmas season's bad vibes and converts them into an achingly funny and corrupt dark comedy. Billy Bob Thornton is Willie T. Stokes, a burned-out, hard-drinking safecracker who's annually roused from sleeping one off during the most wonderful time of the year by his dwarf partner, Marcus (Tony Cox). As Marcus works as a department store elf, he also cases the store so that he and Willie can break in and relieve the joint of valuable merchandise. On this tour, they've ended up in Phoenix, which just adds to the wealth of hilarious incongruity. As a director, Mr. Zwigoff has a taste for finding the dramatic power of self-loathing and making it entertainment. His previous films, the documentary &quot;Crumb&quot; and the his fiction-film debut &quot;Ghost World,&quot; both hinged on coping with epic tides of depression. &quot;Santa&quot; falls directly into that lineage. Mr. Thornton's face is drawn into a rictus of a snarl; his Willie anticipates trouble, and when it doesn't crop up on its own, he has to stir it up from the bottom of the pot.  Willie is filled with the most distorted kind of narcissism imaginable, and for Mr. Thornton, it functions as a kind of star chemistry. Willie ladles it generously on the kids who line up to see him on his wobbly perch on Santa's throne: he's the kind of minimum-wage offal who has sent his victims on to thousands of hours of therapy. —  Elvis Mitchell","2003-11-26","2003-11-26","2017-11-02 04:18:03","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/26/movies/film-review-this-santa-sobers-up-but-only-for-greed.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of Bad Santa'}",NA
"250",9,"In America","",1,"A. O. Scott","Charming Illegal Aliens Facing Family Upheaval","Many of the elements in this picture about an Irish family living in New York —  picturesque poverty, an angelic, doomed black man, a dead child, a pair of cute, precocious daughters, a risky pregnancy toward the end —  seem to promise a sticky bath of shameless sentimentality. But instead, thanks to Jim  Sheridan's graceful, scrupulously sincere direction and the dry intelligence of his cast, &quot;In America&quot; is likely to pierce the defenses of all but the most dogmatically cynical viewers. The film, which Mr. Sheridan wrote with two of his daughters, is unabashedly personal, but he is too modest a filmmaker to turn his own experience into a lesson or a parable. From moment to moment, as it follows Johnny and Sarah Sullivan (Paddy Considine and Samantha Morton, both quietly terrific) through their daily struggles, the story feels small, almost anecdotal. But just as its tactful realism is adorned with a dusting of magic, its unassuming clarity hides an unexpected grandeur. It is the kind of movie that keeps growing in your mind long after you ve seen it, and its characters are so radiantly particular that they come, after a while, to seem like people you know. — A. O.

"251",10,"Triplets of Belleville","PG-13",1,"A. O. Scott","Nostalgia for a Land That Twirls in Dreams","Sylvain Chomet's ravishingly weird animated feature unfolds in a universe of sheer impossibility, where size, proportion and balance are ruled by the whims of the director's perverse pen and his peculiar imagination. Although that imagination has evidently been fed by sources as various as Betty Boop, Jacques Tati and European comic books, its products are too strange to be assimilated into any known tradition. The plot is too bizarre for summary, but it involves the efforts of a diminutive, club-footed grandmother to rescue her grandson, a Tour de France cyclist, from the clutches of the French mafia. Aiding her are her faithful dog, Bruno, and the Triplets of the title, a trio of weird sisters who subsist on a diet of frogs and who make entrancing music with kitchen appliances and old newspapers. The Triplets is a similar collage of the found and the invented. Its style evokes a post-war France making its stubborn, eccentric way into the modern world — a nation of cigarette-rolling truck drivers and accordion-squeezing pop singers. It is surely the oddest movie of the year — by turns sweet and sinister, insouciant and grotesque, invitingly funny and forbiddingly dark. It may also, by dint of Mr. Chomet's sheer inventiveness, be one of the best. — A. O.

The  love Ms. Tom offers has little to do with tearful avowals and hearts and flowers  sentimentality and everything to do with following through, providing strong, thoughtful  care, and firm, but gentle discipline to her children, two of whom face early deaths. The  movie focuses on four young members of Ms. Tom's adopted family: Anthony, a forlorn  20-year-old (who looks about 11) and suffers from a degenerative skin disease that's  excruciatingly painful; Faith, a seven-year-old burn victim; Xenia, who has no legs; and  the house troublemaker, 15-year-old Joe, who suffers from cystic fibrosis and severe  attention deficit disorder.

Her character, Sandra, is a garrulous, weather-beaten truck-stop prostitute  cruising the interstate with her husband in their recreational vehicle. Were it a  mainstream Hollywood movie, this story of a young woman who is taken under their  wing and turned into a working girl would have veered into a nightmarish melodrama of  imprisonment and escape.

Its vision is seen largely through the eyes of Piers Lewis, a good-humored British-born  project director for AES-Telasi, the Arlington, Va.-based company that was created in  late 1990's when AES acquired the Georgian power authority, Telasi. At the time, AES  officials had no idea what they were up against. And the story of the company's struggle  to become efficient and profitable in a country where 90 percent of the citizens refused to pay  electricity bills that amounted to half their monthly income plays like an absurdist  political farce.

This is a romantic farce for and about grownups, which rises above Nancy Meyers occasionally slack writing and direction thanks to its cast, in particular Diane Keaton, who manages to be awkward, valiant, indecisive and very sexy indeed. Her character, Erica Barry, is a divorced playwright whose daughter (Amanda Peet) is involved with Harry Sanborn (Jack Nicholson), a much older man who has never dated a woman over 30. After Harry suffers a heart attack in Erica's East Hampton beach house, she becomes his reluctant nurse, attracting the amorous attention of his doctor (Keanu Reeves). The film, a wry, knowing celebration of middle-age sexuality, is so funny in large part because it acknowledges the inevitability of hurt feelings. The loudest laughter may come when Ms. Keaton, having risked heartbreak and then succumbed to it, bursts into tears, and cries her way to an unlikely and satisfying triumph. — A. O.

But Mr. Jackson crushes any such fear. His &quot;King&quot; is a meticulous and prodigious vision made by a director who was not hamstrung by heavy use of computer special-effects imagery. The final installment  follows the hobbit Frodo (Elijah Wood), increasingly fevered as the ring exercises its power over him, on the last leg of his perilous journey to Mordor to destroy the sinister object.  The wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), in a voice sodden with mellow sadness, believes that Frodo is on a suicide mission: &quot;There never was much hope. Just a false hope.&quot; Mr. Jackson takes his time with the story, but he's not sloughing off here. Rather he is building toward a more than solid conclusion. The grandiloquence that sustained the second installment, &quot;The Two Towers,&quot; with its pounding and operatic martial fury — a movie that actually created a state of siege and left audiences hanging —  can be found here. By its end, &quot;King&quot; glides to the gentle bonhomie that opened the &quot;Ring&quot; movies, but its epilogue is tinged with regret: &quot;You can't go back. Some wounds don't heal.&quot; It's an epic about the price of triumph, a subversive victory itself in a large-scale pop-action film. — Elvis Mitchell","2003-12-16","2003-12-17","2017-11-02 04:18:03","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/16/movies/film-review-triumph-tinged-with-regret-in-middle-earth.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'}",NA

Cathy's attempt to get back the house and Behrani's intransigent refusal to let go of it escalate toward a heavily foreshadowed catastrophe. The movie, adapted from a novel by Andre Dubus III, is the nearly flawed execution of a deeply flawed premise. The logic of the story seems to override the plausible motives of the characters, and you may feel the overwhelming force of the tragic ending without quite believing it. Ms. Connelly is a bit blank, her intelligence trapped by Cathy's passivity, but Mr. Kingsley, playing a patriarch in crisis, is superb. So are Ron Eldard, as the sheriff s deputy whose attempts to help Cathy accelerate the inevitable disaster, and especially Shohreh Aghdashloo, who plays Behrani's weary, good-hearted wife. Vadim Perelman, directing his first feature film, shows himself to be a filmmaker of impressive tact and restraint.

Barrie's novel is bracingly true to the tough, buoyant spirit of the original, and his filmmaking style is a perfect mixture of wide-eyed wonder and slightly melancholy sophistication. While Peter (Jeremy Sumpter) is appropriately dashing and adventurous, Hook (Jason Isaacs) wonderfully villainous and Tinker Bell (Ludivine Sagnier) as cute and naughty as anyone could wish, the movie belongs to Rachel Hurd-Wood's Wendy Darling. Ms. Hurd-Wood, a 13-year-old British actress making her professional debut, was born for the role, which calls on her to be a precocious child, an action heroine, the surrogate mother of a tribe of Lost Boys, and the romantic lead. Her soft, sensitive features display both Wendy's child-like eagerness and her incipient wisdom without overdoing either trait, and she and Mr. Sumpter remind us that Peter Pan, beyond all the swashbuckling and fantasy, is a love story, which ends on a poignant Jamesian note of renunciation. The sets and special effects are rousing and vivid, but what distinguishes this Peter Pan from the other versions (and from most recent children s entertainment) is its unsentimental insight into the terrors and delights of both childhood and growing up. — A.

Loosely based on &quot;3 Godfathers,&quot; John Ford's maudlin 1948 western, this movie, a sweet fable of decency amid the down and out, also has echoes of Chaplin and Capra. Three homeless people — an embittered alcoholic, a middle-aged transvestite and a teenage runaway — find an abandoned baby on Christmas Eve. As they try to reunite the foundling with her parents, they revisit their own unhappy lives, and travel through a city rendered with unbelievable precision and tinted with undeniable love. The potentially sticky sentiments of the story are balanced by a crazily inventive narrative and by Mr. Kon's cool, obsessively detailed visual style. At the end, the skyscrapers of Tokyo wriggle and dance to a Japanese-language techno version of Beethoven's &quot;Ode to Joy,&quot; which pretty much sums up this indescribable, unforgettable movie. — A.

It helps when the drawn stuff has a touch of individuality, and the artist Gary Baseman — creator of both the Saturday morning cartoon show and this sure-footed, blessedly swift movie that was derived from it — couldn't be more idiosyncratic. Nathan Lane's shameless vocal theatrics is a perfect fit for the character he voices, Spot, a relentlessly chatty blue dog whose ambition to be a human boy instead of a doggy is realized by slipping into a pair of shorts, a bright yellow short-sleeved shirt and  a pair of glasses. When Spot hears about Dr. Krank (Kelsey Grammer), the mad scientist who has perfected the technology of turning animals into humans, he scampers off to Florida to undergo treatment. &quot;Teacher's Pet&quot; will reward your close attention with a gratifyingly high ratio of humor.

The story follows three mounted policemen and an Aboriginal tracker on a mission to bring to justice a black man accused of murdering a white woman. The characters have symbolic names like the Tracker, the Fanatic, the Follower, the Veteran and the Fugitive. Gary Sweet's Fanatic is as scary a racist fiend as has ever been brought to the screen.

"264",3,"Blind Shaft","Not Rated",1,"Elvis Mitchell","Descending Into the Pit of Humanity","It's the last thing you'd expect — that a film that functions as both a commentary on socialism and a film noir could be entirely compelling. That's the case for Li Yang's  &quot;Blind Shaft&quot; and the China-set story allows him to create a hybrid and convey his documentary experience, steadily adding more and more character detail until a dazzling shocker moment at its climax; it's as if someone had unearthed a nonfiction film made by Cornell Woolrich.  &quot;Shaft&quot; starts in a dilapidated mining complex, and the picture has the bleak, grinding atmosphere of a real-life look at underpaid, trapped miners doing their jobs; a spooky shot of an elevator descending into the mine rings true because it creates mood and, later, serves as metaphor. Initially, the picture is harsh and claustrophobic enough to make us expect we're going to have to endure a collapse that will strand the workers in the dark, hard-to-see environment. Eventually, there is a collapse —  but it occurs after one of the workers kills a man and flees the site. His partner makes a bogus claim against the mine owner, extorting a payoff over the death of his &quot;brother,&quot; who died in the avalanche. This is the life they lead, moving from one shabby mining operation to another, conjuring faked ID's and collecting on the death of a &quot;relative.&quot; They then burn through the money on whores and alcohol. The mine owners they bilk are just as heartless —  they'd rather throw money at the problem instead of have it investigated.  Because &quot;Shaft&quot; is directed with airtight ruthlessness, its relentless and tough-minded storytelling has a grueling precision. The film wrings humor out of the pettiness of its determined killers. Its brooding meticulousness, and lack of flourish, evokes an old-school B-picture before the genre was over-inflated — and sentimentalized — into big-budget doggerel here in the United States; &quot;Shaft&quot; could be set in one of those faded boomtowns outside of Las Vegas and guided by Sam Fuller. The wan, gray skies and omnipresent squalor give the movie the feel of a black and white film, though splashes of color filter through occasionally. When someone does get around to remaking &quot;Shaft&quot; — and the film deserves such revisiting — let's hope the new version doesn't implode from gooey or overstated emotion.  &quot;Shaft&quot; deftly swings to a spartan, engrossing climax, and the final twists spell out what the murderers are made of and the setting responsible for them in the first place: a true piece of film magic. — Elvis Mitchell","2004-02-04","","2017-11-02 04:16:23","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/04/movies/film-review-descending-into-the-pit-of-humanity.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of Blind Shaft'}",NA
"265",4,"Vozvraschenie","Not Rated",1,"Dave Kehr","A Frayed Family, an Ominous Fishing Trip","The winner of the grand prize at the 2003 Venice Film Festival, &quot;The Return&quot; is the stunning feature film debut of Andrey Zvyagintsev, a 39-year-old Russian director who here renews the grand tradition of Russian cinematic mysticism epitomized by Andrei Tarkovsky.  With a storyline at once enigmatic and psychologically acute, the film draws on biblical motifs to tell a story of the brothers Vanya (Ivan Dobronravov) and Andrey (Vladimir Garin), adolescents who have grown up in a small, depressed town in the care of their mother (Natalia Vdovina), their father having disappeared sometime after Vanya's birth. Mr. Zvyagintsev creates a most moving tension between his massive, archetypical themes and the bristling specificity of his characters.  The film is at once highly naturalistic and dreamily abstract, playing out its mythic themes through vibrantly detailed characterizations (and remarkable performances by the entire cast).  It's the work of a major new talent. — Dave Kehr","2004-02-06","","2017-11-02 04:16:23","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/06/movies/film-review-a-frayed-family-an-ominous-fishing-trip.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of Vozvraschenie'}",NA
"266",5,"Osama","PG-13",1,"A. O. Scott","In a Land of Female Repression, a Girl Survives as a Boy","Working with nonprofessional actors and a tiny budget, Siddiq Barmak's film is the first feature made in Afghanistan since before the rise of the Taliban — an impressive achievement made more so by the director's sure and subtle artistry. Without rancor, but also without averting his eyes from the cruelty of the Taliban's rule, Mr. Barmak paints a desolate picture of daily life under a capricious authoritarian regime that was especially harsh in its treatment of women. When her mother is chased out of her job at a dusty Kabul hospital, a young girl disguises herself as a boy and goes to work for a sympathetic shopkeeper, and as her ordeal reveals the many forms of Taliban brutality, the film also has moments of lyricism, tenderness and even comedy, as in one unforgettable sequence that explores the paradoxical idea of radical Islamist sex education. — A.

"267",6,"The Dreamers","NC-17",1,"A. O. Scott","When Young Was Sexy and Paris Simmered","Bernardo Bertolucci began his career with the observation that he who has not lived before the revolution has never tasted the sweetness of life. His newest film, an ardently romantic love song to sex, cinema and the spirit of the 60's, elaborates on this observation by finding sweetness in the midst of political tumult. The disturbances of 1968 in Paris take place mostly off screen, bursting in only at the end to wake up the three title characters. The trio —  an American exchange student (Michael Pitt) and a pair of lovely, moody half-French twins (Eva Green and Louis Garrel) — spend most of the picture holed up in a luxuriously squalid Paris apartment, having sex and arguing about movies, politics and the relative merits of Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix. Instead of mocking or patronizing their passion (as some critics are sure to do), Mr. Bertolucci treats these silly, earnest, beautiful young people tenderly and with generosity. As a testament to their love of movies, he inserts archival film clips culled from the repertory of the Cinémathèque Française, where the three met and where the events of May began. To feed the audiences love, he photographs his fearless young actors and their surroundings with breathtaking grace. Even if the sight of naked bodies leaves you cold, some of the director's camera movements can make you gasp with delight. — A. O.

"268",7,"50 First Dates","PG-13",1,"A. O. Scott","A Love That's Forever, if Only for a Day","For its first few minutes, this romantic comedy, directed by a veteran builder of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; star vehicles, looks like another crude, bullying Adam Sandler extravaganza: there are vulgar sexual jokes, a vomiting walrus and the never entirely welcome appearance of Rob Schneider, who plays a Hawaiian stoner named Ula. But then Drew Barrymore shows up as Lucy, a lovely art teacher suffering from temporal lobe damage, and everything starts looking up. She goes after Mr. Schneider with a baseball bat, and engages Mr. Sandler, who plays an easy-going, womanizing veterinarian, in a clever and touching romantic comedy. The film's conceit — Lucy's injury has destroyed her short-term memory, so that she starts each day with no recollection of the one before — is reminiscent of Harold Ramis's immortal &quot;Groundhog Day.&quot; While &quot;50 First Dates,&quot; deftly directed by Peter Segal from George Wing's witty and heartfelt script, does not have that film's philosophical ambitions, it does follow its premise to a risky conclusion that pays off beautifully. — A.

"269",8,"Lost Boys of Sudan","Not Rated",1,"Elvis Mitchell","Coping in a Land That's Not Quite Heaven","When one of the hopeful teenagers in this film, talking about his upcoming trip to America, remarks that &quot;The journey is like you are going to heaven,&quot; your heart sinks.  But in this well-organized and fascinating movie, the tidy and intelligent filmmakers Megan Mylan and Jon Shenk follow the accretions of small defeats that don't sap the will of the young Africans transplanted to the United States to make a better life for themselves. &quot;You are the future of Sudan,&quot; the boys are told as they prepare to leave their homeland. The film, which primarily follows two of the boys, Peter and Santino, over the course of a year, doesn't make us dread that line about a heaven that may not materialize. At its core, &quot;Sudan&quot; becomes about coping with loneliness, as alienation increases and both young men — like their newly arrived tribesmen — are orphaned into trying to stay afloat. Hearing the African teenagers joke about the customs they can no longer observe — like the familiar touching considered homosexual behavior in America — only italicizes the spiritual distance between America and Africa. The nearly unlimited access the directors have to the lives of their subjects intensifies the narrative, because it allows us to drift along in the swells and eddies of Peter and Santino's time in the United States. The filmmakers don't shy away from touchy issues, like the schism between the Sudanese and American blacks. Subtly, &quot;Lost Boys of Sudan&quot; provides a sense of what its subjects have traded — sacrificed, really — to come to America. Getting an audience so caught up is no small feat, and a tribute to the directors' storytelling. And though that early reference to heaven on earth — hovering and poised for contradiction — is answered by the end of &quot;Sudan,&quot; by then the film has earned the right to do so. — Elvis Mitchell","2004-02-18","","2017-11-02 04:16:23","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/18/movies/film-review-coping-in-a-land-that-s-not-quite-heaven.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of Lost Boys of Sudan'}",NA
"270",9,"Kitchen Stories","Not Rated",1,"Elvis Mitchell","Scandinavian Comedy, No Knees Slapped","The Norwegian writer and director Bent Hamer's wry, uninflected deadpan social comedy points as straight and true as a compass fixed on magnetic north. It has the tingly, dry shock of a snootful of sub-zero air. The material itself is so minimal that it makes a New Yorker cartoon look like an episode of &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants.&quot; Folke (Tomas Norstrom) is an expert from the Swedish Home Research, part of a project to track the domestic habits of Norwegian bachelors. He moves into the home of one of the study's subjects, Isak (Joachim Calmeyer), a bizarre codger who pads around his tiny, uncomfortable house. Isak turns the tables at night by slipping into his attic and spying on the lonely Folke, who lives in a trailer on Isak's property. Mr. Hamer takes what sounds like a constricted and unpromising premise, and gets the most out of the modest contradictions. He maximizes the concept, through an entrancing visual flair and, eventually, a tiny depth of feeling. He keeps the film compact, and the design scheme of this postwar era has dash and vigor. The retro polish of &quot;Kitchen Stories&quot; comments on the loneliness of utilitarian design. Folke might as well be a vowel floating in a Campbell Soup can. — Elvis Mitchell","2004-02-20","","2017-11-02 04:16:22","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/20/movies/film-review-scandinavian-comedy-no-knees-slapped.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of Kitchen Stories'}",NA

A giant Bactrian camel, left behind by a traveling circus, is adopted by Zygmunt and Marysia Zawicki (Mr. Stuhr and Anna Dymna), a middle-aged, childless couple whose lives are both enriched and disrupted by the animal's presence. The camel, a slow-moving, deadpan metaphor, becomes the center of a civic scandal, and the movie, like many works of art that originated in Communist Eastern Europe, is both patently allegorical and teasingly oblique. — A.

Étienne Sauret's intimate, heartbreaking documentaries, &quot;Collateral Damages,&quot; which interviews several firefighters, and the near-wordless &quot;The First 24 Hours,&quot; return to those primal events and their immediate aftermath. Both films are meditations on the scale of a catastrophe so enormous that all the assembled rescue resources seem paltry and inadequate. Many grief-stricken, traumatized words are uttered in &quot;Collateral Damages,&quot; a personal scrapbook of the memories of several firefighters who survived the horrors.  Despite its anguish, the movie suggests that time does heal, and that even the worst memories eventually sink in and are absorbed. — Stephen Holden","2004-03-03","","2017-11-02 04:16:23","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/03/movies/film-review-anguished-emotions-smoldering-since-9-11.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of Collateral Damages'}",NA

Plenty of love floats among the Ullmans, but just as much bottled-up rage, despair and  guilt leaks out. Because the mother has to work as a nightshift midwife in a Haifa  hospital, her two rebellious oldest children, 17 and 16, are forced to take care of the  youngest two. One day, a small act of forgetfulness precipitates a grave new family crisis. — Stephen Holden","2004-03-12","","2019-07-01 18:14:02","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/12/movies/film-review-dad-dies-leaving-a-caldron-of-rage-despair-and-love.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of Broken Wings'}",NA

Neil Young, in fine voice, balances his disgust at the current state of the world with his cranky faith in the resilience of the human spirit. The Greens —  especially Grandpa and Sun, a radiant environmentalist —  share  their creator's stubborn defiance as they take on the media, the government  and the soul-destroying, earth-polluting power of big corporations. The 10 songs that blanket the soundtrack are stripped-down anthems and   lamentations, and they secure Mr. Young's position as an inimitable —  and indispensable —  rock 'n' roll prophet. — A. O.

"275",14,"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind","R",1,"Elvis Mitchell","Washing That Girl Out of His Head","Michel Gondry's film, an angular and intelligent romantic comedy, isn't entirely consistent. Even as you laugh, it's a movie you admire more than love. Mr. Gondry, displaying an impressively quicksilver, scrambling technique, is working with a much better script than he had for &quot;Human Nature,&quot; his previous collaboration with the screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (&quot;Being John Malkovich,&quot; &quot;Adaptation&quot;).  Kate Winslet is Clem, the brash, loquacious bookstore employee who meets Joel (Jim Carrey) as he wanders the streets alone on Valentine's Day. The two of them fall in love under a glum, flannel cloud cover that could use some eternal sunshine.  After they break up, Joel's ego is bruised when he finds out that Clem has had all memories of him erased from her mind. Devastated, he goes for the same treatment. Mr. Kaufman has conjured the film equivalent of a Philip K. Dick Hallmark card. The movie has all of the knickknacks of a Kaufman script, including a nerdy, socially inept protagonist. In the case of &quot;Mind,&quot; this translates into Joel's being the least developed character. Mr. Carrey does get to show some aplomb in the final scene, when Joel acts out the most mature sentiment ever found in a Kaufman script, that having one's psyche purged isn't necessarily a good thing. What becomes of the broken-hearted, after the conversation has dimmed, is that they get over it. And by concluding with an adult realization, the film lets sunlight peek through the gloom, in more ways than one. — Elvis Mitchell","2004-03-19","2004-03-19","2017-11-02 04:18:03","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/19/movies/film-review-washing-that-girl-out-of-his-head.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'}",NA

Movie stars, spies,  government ministers and jailbirds collide in a panoramic gridlock when the advancing  German army threatens Paris and the city's upper crust flees en masse to the Hotel  Splendide in Bordeaux. The film, with many subplots, blurs the line between comedy and  epic drama so adroitly that the two styles fuse into something quite original: a lyrical  farce that pays homage to its period in any number of ways. Isabelle  Adjani portrays a  spoiled, pouting movie star whose manipulation of once and future lovers, keeps  everybody hopping. — Stephen Holden","2004-03-19","2004-05-21","2017-11-02 04:18:03","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/19/movies/film-review-it-s-france-1940-and-farce-is-in-the-air.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of Bon Voyage'}",NA
"277",16,"Never Die Alone","R",1,"Elvis Mitchell","Dying Without Remorse, a Bad Guy Who's Lonely","With his compulsively slamming lyrics and king-of-the-world delivery, DMX intuitively echoed the projects-existentialism of the novelist Donald Goines for years. He's the perfect actor for the film adaptation of Goines's &quot;Never Die Alone,&quot; directed with street-corner majesty by the cinematographer-turned-director Ernest Dickerson. DMX stars as the drug dealer King David, who pops up in the streets again after a long absence. Rolling into the frame in a player's classic — a late 70's Stutz Blackhawk — King David shrugs his way back into the hard-knock life. He quickly reaps what he sows and, mortally wounded, passes all his worldly goods to Paul (David Arquette), a scrambling white would-be writer. King David's estate includes an audio journal of his life, which provides flashbacks and a narrative-within-a-narrative that answers the shaken Paul's curiosity. It's the highlights of King David's high life that propel &quot;Alone.&quot; Like all of Goines's heroes, King David is a scourge on the periphery, and the movie dramatizes his corrosive effect on the margins with savvy muscularity. Every life he touches he leaves in ruins — a need to deface beauty as a result of self-loathing is implicit, and DMX signals that motivation with sly hostility. To say that King David is the best part he's ever had is an understatement; he has never felt the need to inhabit a movie in this way before. — Elvis Mitchell","2004-03-26","2004-03-26","2017-11-02 04:18:03","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/26/movies/film-review-dying-without-remorse-a-bad-guy-who-s-lonely.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of Never Die Alone'}",NA

The placid surface of Kim Ki Duk's lovely film is disturbed by eruptions of intense emotion, occasionally verging on melodrama, and by an intrusive soundtrack. But the film, with its moments of sharp humor (and the beguiling appearances of a white cat, a wry turtle and a quizzical rooster), is both sensual and austere, an exercise in spiritual discipline that sharpens your perception of human nature and the natural world. — A.

"281",0,"Hellboy","PG-13",1,"Elvis Mitchell","Horror Comic at the Core, With a Soulful Sweetness","Mike Mignola's &quot;Hellboy&quot; comics have a drizzly, musty gothic ambience. Guillermo del Toro has brought a similar woozy, disconcerting melancholy to his film adaptation, and his obvious affection and affinity  for that dankness alone would make &quot;Hellboy&quot; worth seeing. But Mr. del Toro lets loose with an all-American, vaudevillian rambunctiousness that makes the movie daffy, loose and lovable. The story is pretty complicated stuff: during World War II, Hitler sends a special squad, led by Rasputin (Karel Roden), to rend the dimensional bonds and obtain a creature that will give the edge to the Nazis. His conjuring leads to the emergence of an infant creature, red as sin, with a long tail, who falls into the hands of the Allies. The kindly British scientist Dr. Broom (John Hurt) tames the tiny scarlet devil with a Baby Ruth the size of a Bazooka. Adopted by Dr. Broom, Hellboy, with his huge stone-like left arm, grows up to be the go-to guy for the good doctor and the anti-apparition league known as the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense. What gives &quot;Hellboy&quot; squirmy, ferocious life is the environment that Mr. del Toro creates onscreen. It's this texture that he avidly lavishes on &quot;Hellboy&quot; that offers the kiss of distinction.  It's an elegant haunted house of a picture, with dread and yearning part of the eeriness. Ron Perlman's performance as Hellboy, and his mastery of bad-tempered volubility, makes the film a kind of screwball comedy version of the Thing from the Fantastic Four comics. Like any American comedy protagonist, he's always trying to explain himself and do what's right. That ambition is what gets him into trouble and is the truest definition of Hell. — Elvis Mitchell","2004-04-02","2004-04-02","2017-11-02 04:18:03","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/02/movies/film-review-horror-comic-at-the-core-with-a-soulful-sweetness.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of Hellboy'}",NA

Anne Hathaway, the vivacious young star of &quot;The Princess Diaries,&quot; plays the title character, a put-upon teenager in a storybook world whose widowed father (Patrick Bergin) has injudiciously married Dame Olga (Joanna Lumley, of &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;), the mother of all wicked stepmothers.  She comes complete with a pair of entertainingly hateful daughters (Lucy Punch and Jennifer Higham), who like nothing better than torturing Ella — particularly once they discover that, thanks to a questionable gift bestowed by a fairy (Vivica A.

As Ella sets out to find the errant fairy and convince her to revoke her dubious present, the screenwriters Laurie Craig, Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith (working from a novel by Gail Carson Levine) take her through various effects-filled realms, including a land where elves are forced by the evil regent to sing, dance and be relentlessly merry, and a forced labor compound for giants that looks disturbingly like a concentration camp.

They drive, bicker, go for ice cream, squabble and have sex (explicitly, repeatedly and grotesquely). Finally their torpor is  blasted in a graphic, horrifying eruption of random violence. Bruno Dumont does not trust  words to convey reality. Like his earlier two movies, &quot;La Vie de Jesus&quot; and &quot;Humanite,&quot;  &quot;Twentynine Palms&quot; (his first film made in the United States) portrays a relentlessly ominous world in which humans are just another form of animal life and a potentially  dangerous one, ruled by brute instincts and volatile emotions. What makes his films riveting to those who can stomach them (and many can't) is his gift for putting on the  screen the quivering essence of physical life as its experienced moment by moment. — Stephen Holden","2004-04-09","","2017-11-02 04:16:21","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/09/movies/film-review-feral-essence-of-living-few-words-are-needed.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of Twentynine Palms'}",NA
"285",4,"Kill Bill Vol. 2","R",1,"Elvis Mitchell","Vengeance Still Mine, Saith the Lethal Bride","When a writer-director — Cameron Crowe or Paul Thomas Anderson, for example — is in love with his characters, the fun comes when the filmmaker lets them gab away, inadvertently revealing themselves. The joy when Quentin Tarantino's creations speak is the opposite. Despite their hilariously florid rapping, his folks are also incredibly cagey: they never give the entire game away. This shrewdness is the template for the long dialogues in &quot;Kill Bill, Vol. 2,&quot; the most voluptuous comic-book movie ever made.   In this deliciously perverse picture, everything is operatic, including the despair and the pauses. Uma Thurman, whose speaking voice has a lyric, teasing quality, is just the performer to get the mordant slyness across. Mr. Tarantino's movies are also about loss and betrayal, and &quot;Vol. 2&quot; is a double-burger helping of those motifs. It is rich, substantial and sustained, yet also greasy kids' stuff, a wrapper filled with an extra large order of chili fries, stained with ketchup, salt and cheese. &quot;Vol. 1&quot; was all set-up: the longest first act in movie history, staged and edited like a series of Pablo Ferro trailers. &quot;Vol. 2&quot; is the second and third acts in one convenient serving, told in a languorous flashback-within-a-flashback style with airy long takes. Unlike the 100-meter high-hurdles of &quot;Vol. 1,&quot; this sequel is a marathon, with hills and long stretches of flatland. As in the first film, the Bride (Ms. Thurman) is on a mission of vengeance after being shot and left for dead; she's out to murder her former colleagues led by Bill (David Carradine). She calls her journey a roaring rampage of revenge. The movie, which quivers with a geek-adrenaline rush, in some ways feels like its time may have passed; this feels likes a movie Mr. Tarantino might have made before &quot;Pulp Fiction.&quot; — Elvis Mitchell","2004-04-16","2004-04-16","2017-11-02 04:18:03","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/16/movies/film-review-vengeance-still-mine-saieth-the-lethal-bride.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of Kill Bill Vol. 2'}",NA

The play, which revisits some of Mr. Shepard's signature themes, is based partly on the life of his alcoholic father. Sean Penn and Nick Nolte play a pair of embittered brothers dealing with the consequences of the old man's passing, and there is great pleasure to be had in watching these Method powerhouses  at work. Woody Harrelson and Cheech Marin, who have supporting roles in the play, are on hand to lighten the heavy Stanislavskian atmosphere. &#151; A. O.

Scott","Elegy for the Unflinching Conscience of Haiti","A magnificent documentary about the life of Jean Dominique, a Haitian radio broadcaster who was, until his murder in 2000, a brave and tireless voice for democracy and human rights in that unlucky country. In part, the film is a chronicle of that bad luck, as Haiti alternates between chaos and authoritarianism, with glimmers of hope quickly giving way to compromise, corruption and violence. Jonathan Demme interviewed Mr. Dominique and his wife, Michelle Mortas, many times over the years, both in Haiti and during periods of exile in New York, and these conversations, along with Wyclef Jean's bubbling score, give &quot;The Agronomist&quot; a lively immediacy unusual in documentaries of its kind. By the end, you come not simply to admire Dominique; you want to count yourself, as Mr. Demme clearly does, among his friends. Unfortunately, you will also have a clear sense of his enemies, the gangsters and strongmen who have run Haiti, usually with American support, for most of its modern history. — A. O.

Isabella Rossellini plays a legless Winnipeg beer baroness who, in the grim Depression year of 1933, announces a competition to determine which nation makes the most melancholy music. The musical numbers are wrapped around a plot involving sibling rivalry, national identity and loss, in which Mark McKinney, with a perpetual sneer and an Art Deco moustache, conspired against his father and his brother to win the big prize. Shot in grainy, ghostly black and white, with occasional splashes of color and an honestly heartbreaking score, this film, like Mr. Maddin's best work, is both a tribute to a movie past that never existed and a premonition of a seductive alternative future. — A.

"289",8,"Oasis","",1,"Stephen Holden","In Two Who Aren't Normal, a Normal Need for Love","This remarkable if overlong Korean film strips away much of the sentimentality and goody-two-shoes attitudes that the movies traditionally attach to disabled people. At the same time, it coolly indicts an indifferent world that treats its misfits as inconvenient, half-witted children who are easily exploited and abused. Shortly after Hong Jong-Du (Sol Kyung-gu), the learning-disabled middle brother of three sons  in a bourgeois Korean family, returns home after serving three years in prison, he  meets the more seriously disabled Han Gong-Ju (Moon So-ri), who suffers from cerebral  palsy so severe she can't make herself understood. The passionate bond that develops between them brings them joy but leads to personal disaster. The film's extraordinary lead performances refuse to soft-pedal the severity of their afflictions. By not turning away, softening or adopting a saccharine tone, the film breaks through the couple's  isolation (and through our own prejudice and frustration) so that the sweethearts emerge  as full, achingly human characters. &#151; Stephen Holden","2004-05-07","2004-05-07","2017-11-02 04:18:03","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/07/movies/film-review-in-two-who-aren-t-normal-a-normal-need-for-love.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of Oasis'}",NA

Not that the people in the film are always having such a good time: they seem, rather, to get on one another's nerves with some regularity. Some of the chapters are almost vanishingly slight —  hipster anecdotes that float away like smoke rings. Others —  notably a hotel bar encounter in which Cate Blanchett plays both herself and a resentful cousin and a game of celebrity one-upmanship between Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan —  have the compact perfection of good one-act plays.

"291",10,"Strayed","Not Rated",1,"Stephen Holden","Thrown Together Amid War, They Slowly Grow Together","André Téchiné's taut, swift wartime drama, set in the early days of the German  occupation of France, begins with a montage of devastating black-and-white news clips  interwoven with flashes of the flight south of a terrified young widow (Emmanuelle Béart) and her  two children, a 13-year-old boy (Gregoire Leprince-Ringuet) and 7-year-old girl (Clemence Meyer). When a German air strike leaves the family car a burnt-out shell, a boyish young stranger (Gaspard Ulleil) guides them into the woods where they find  refuge in a grand abandoned house. The movie plays multiple variations on the theme of initiation, as the foursome improvises a structured family life and delicately lays out  fundamental conflicts: between survivalist and bourgeois perspectives; between wartime  and peacetime expectations; between habitually clinging to family values and fending for  yourself. Until their precarious idyll is finally interrupted, each of the four is forced to stretch and grow up in uncomfortable ways. — Stephen Holden","2004-05-14","","2017-11-02 04:16:22","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/14/movies/film-review-thrown-together-amid-war-they-slowly-grow-together.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of Strayed'}",NA
"292",11,"Carandiru","R",1,"Stephen Holden","Inside a Notorious Prison, Fires of Rage and Regret","The human life teeming through this sprawling portrait of Brazil's criminal class crowded within a notorious penitentiary exudes a throbbing flesh-and-blood intensity that's so compelling it's impossible to avert your eyes. Watching this messy epic feels a little like being jammed into an un-air-conditioned subway car on a steamy summer night as it rattles through an urban wasteland. At any second, things could explode. And eventually they do. It is the 1980's, and the setting is Sao Paolo's real-life House of Detention, which was torn down in 2002, a decade after a riot led to the massacre of 111 inmates by the police. The film is a splashy return to form by the celebrated director of  &quot;Pixote&quot; and &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman.&quot; In examining social ills, it interweaves multiple stories of the prisoners' lives as viewed by a doctor volunteering his services.  Below its documentary-like sprawl, &quot;Carandiru&quot; is a hands-on movie passionately engaged in its characters' personal dramas. Just when it threatens to go soft, it erupts in what may be the most horrific prison riot ever filmed. — Stephen Holden","2004-05-14","","2017-11-02 04:16:20","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/14/movies/film-review-inside-a-notorious-prison-fires-of-rage-and-regret.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of Carandiru'}",NA
"293",12,"The Five Obstructions","Not Rated",1,"A. O. Scott","A Cinematic Duel of Wits for Two Danish Directors","Lars Von Trier, notorious tormentor of innocent, defenseless women, picks on someone his own size this time, a fellow Danish filmmaker named Jorgen Leth. In the 1960's, Mr. Leth made a 12-minute film called &quot;The Perfect Human,&quot; which Mr. von Trier claims to have seen 20 times and which he assigns his elder colleague to remake. The five new versions are made under increasingly exigent and absurd constraints — one is a cartoon, one must be shot in the worst place on earth and one must contain no shot lasting more than half a second — and the results are fascinating and strange. The heart of &quot;The Five Obstructions,&quot; though, is the psychological drama that develops as the mercurial Mr. von Trier faces off against the cool, implacable Mr. Leth. This examination of the arbitrariness and irrationality at the heart of the creative progress makes you wonder why anyone in his right mind would make a movie, and also grateful that oddballs like Mr. von Trier and Mr. Leth, against all reason, bother to do so. — A.

"294",13,"The Mother","R",1,"Stephen Holden","Trying to Sidestep Old Age With a Brisk Leap Into Bed","Anne Reid's character, May, is a recently widowed grandmother who pursues an affair with her daughter's hunky, unhappily married  boyfriend (Mr. Craig). The sight of a dilapidated woman besotted with a careless young  god in his 30's may be uncomfortably taboo busting. But the extraordinarily clear-sighted  and psychologically balanced British drama stares as calmly at May's perilous leap into churning emotional rapids as a medical show does when keeping its gaze fixed on a tricky surgical procedure. The bravery of Ms. Reid's screen performance can be measured by her utter  lack of self-consciousness when naked before the camera. When desire trumps May's  maternal feelings, and she knowingly (and guiltily) risks exile from her family to pursue  a hopeless infatuation, she is achingly believable. Hanif Kureishi's screenplay is infused  with an unwavering Chekhovian compassion. Neither good nor evil, its characters are  complicated, ordinary people coping as best they can with their emotional wounds and  their fear of the future, grabbing at illusions of salvation and whatever zest they can drag  into their lives, even while suspecting that the most passion can provide is a temporary  quick fix. — Stephen Holden","2004-05-28","2004-06-18","2017-11-02 04:18:03","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/28/movies/film-review-trying-to-sidestep-old-age-with-a-brisk-leap-into-bed.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of The Mother'}",NA

The portrait that emerges is of a cantankerous misanthrope zestfully living out his legend as a profane realist and professional lowlife, whose lean, brutal literary style allowed no sentimentality. He wryly credits his abusive childhood in which his father regularly beat him for no reason as helping form his style. Without straining, the film makes a strong case for Bukowski as a major American poet whose work was a slashing rebuke to polite academic formalism. — Stephen Holden","2004-06-04","","2017-11-02 04:16:22","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/04/movies/film-review-a-poet-weaned-on-pain-and-reared-by-adversity.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of Bukowski: Born Into This'}",NA

Scott","An Émigré's Paradise Lost and Found","Tom Hanks plays Viktor Navorski, a traveler from a fictitious Eastern European country who spends a year stranded in the International Arrivals Terminal at Kennedy Airport. What sounds like a nightmare turns out to be a soothing comic dream, thanks to Steven Spielberg's playful virtuosity, and also to the talents of the cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, who infuses the neutral, unwelcoming architecture of the airport with soft, radiant light. The story is a bit soft: Viktor is befriended by a motley group of airport workers, bedeviled by a Homeland Security apparatchik (Stanley Tucci) and beguiled by an unhappy flight attendant (Catherine Zeta-Jones). There is a bit too much easy sentiment and artificial sweetness, and Ms. Zeta-Jones's character is woefully underwritten. But these flaws cannot dispel the film's deep enchantment. Mr. Hanks, like Mr. Spielberg, has nothing left to prove, and the nuances lurking in his sly, genial performance emerge only in retrospect. Similarly, the movie's deepest engagement with some of the central anxieties of modern life can be found not in its plot but in its ambience. It is a visual tour de force that turns fear into optimism, loneliness into solidarity, and frustration into resourcefulness. — A. O.

This seductive Italian film uses the image of beautiful strangers secretly and obsessively studying each other through opposite windows, to reflect on two related romantic syndromes, the &quot;grass is always greener&quot; and the &quot;absence makes the heart grow fonder&quot; quandaries. Instead of encasing the characters in a Hitchcockian murder mystery, the film compares the fantasies of possible lovers (Giovanna Messogiorno and Raoul Bova) to the romantic, six-decade-old memories of a mysterious octogenerian (Massimo Girotti), whose story gradually comes to focus.

The first hour is a Pop Art chronicle of suffering and indignity, as poor Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) struggles with the loneliness and frustration of being an anonymous urban crime fighter. His powers are waning, he has lost the respect of the woman he loves, and even Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) seems a little disappointed in him. Meanwhile, a new supervillain, the tragic and terrifying Doc Ock (Mr. Molina), rampages through New York on mechanical arms with minds of their own. There is plenty of noise and color, and some so-so special effects, but the real thrill comes from Sam Raimi's devotion to his hero's complex, conflicted emotional life, and to the melancholy, grown-up love story that develops between Peter and MJ (Kirsten Dunst), who comes into her own as a strong and decisive character, while still fulfilling the traditional comic-book girlfriend duties of screaming, getting kidnapped and being rescued. — A.

This time, it is even briefer: the film unfolds, without skipping a minute, in the hour or so before Jess must catch a plane home to New York, and all those minutes are filled with looping, self-conscious talk as the reunited lovers wander along the Seine.   Their intimacy is tinged with nostalgic regret. The airy sense of freedom   that they shared in their early 20's has given way to the resignation of adulthood, even as they meander toward a second chance. The liberating   sweetness of the earlier movie has mellowed into a saltier, sadder flavor, but Richard Linklater, one of our most literate and intelligent directors, has not talked himself out of the possibility of romance, and the movie's relaxed, discursive structure is dense with implied feeling and oblique drama. — A.

"301",0,"Inheritance","Not Rated",1,"Stephen Holden","An Executive's Hard Choices and the Toll They Take","Filmed mostly in shades of gray, this sleek, desolate fable about the conflict between corporate values and human needs gives the upscale ethos that engulfs its characters a bleak palette all its own. The central  character, Christoffer (Ulrich Thomsen), forsakes a carefree life in Stockholm to assume  control of his family's floundering steel works after his father commits suicide. Part of  the story revolves around the tug of war between his domineering mother (Ghita Norby)  and his beautiful wife (Lisa Werlinder), who puts her promising acting career on hold to move from Stockholm to Copenhagen. &quot;The Inheritance&quot; reminds you in painful detail that one of the tasks of a financially responsible executive is to execute. As he turns the business around, his decisions tear apart his family and erode his marriage. You can read the Danish film as an unsettling parable about any corporation, or, for that matter, any country forced to take stringent financial measures to avoid catastrophe. For all the pain he inflicts, Christoffer might even be seen as a self-sacrificing hero. But as the morose movie shows, a corporate hero is many ways the antithesis of a humanitarian. — Stephen Holden","2004-07-09","2004-07-09","2017-11-02 04:18:03","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/09/movies/film-review-an-executive-s-hard-choices-and-the-toll-they-take.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of Inheritance'}",NA
"302",1,"The Door in the Floor","R",1,"A. O.

Jon Foster plays Eddie, a prep school student who spends a long, eventful summer working as an assistant to Ted Cole (Jeff Bridges), a famous writer and illustrator of children's books. Ted and his wife, Marion (Kim Basinger), are still grieving over the loss of their two sons in a car accident years before, and their marriage is falling apart. All of this might have made for maudlin, precious melodrama — especially when Eddie and Marion commence their affair — but rather than emphasize the plot, Mr. Williams makes it a relaxed, roomy landscape for the characters to roam around in. The cast rises above the occasional implausibility of the material, and the movie is funny, touching and understated. It is dominated by Mr. Bridges's performance, one of the finest pieces of screen acting by an American man so far this year, a heroically life-sized portrait of wounded narcissism and masculine need. — A.

"303",2,"Maria Full of Grace","R",1,"Stephen Holden","A Mule's Long Trek in Search of the North American Dream","It's painfully understandable why the 17-year-old title character of this gripping Colombian film would risk her freedom and even her life to be a drug mule. The movie follows the desperate plunge of Maria (Catalina Sandino  Moreno) from a dead-end job as an assembly-line worker in a Colombian flower factory  into the drug-smuggling underworld. Her dangerous undertaking is her last resort when she finds herself unemployed and pregnant. Before the story zeroes in on the harrowing details of drug running and its dangers, it details Maria's hopelessly circumscribed life in a rural village. If her story is a template for countless others like it, what keeps your heart in your throat is Maria herself. In a performance that feels more lived in than acted, Ms.  Moreno's Maria is an attractive, smart, spirited young woman who faces the challenge of  fending for herself with a fierce determination and ingenuity that compromises but never  undermines her essential decency and morality. The movie sustains a documentary authenticity that is as astonishing as it is off-handed. Even while keeping you on the edge of your seat, it never sacrifices a calm, clear-sighted humanity for the sake of melodrama or cheap moralizing. &#151; Stephen Holden","2004-07-16","2004-08-06","2017-11-02 04:18:04","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/16/movies/film-review-a-mule-s-long-trek-in-search-of-the-north-american-dream.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of Maria Full of Grace'}",NA

But in the wake of 9/11, this globetrotting post-cold war melodrama full of standard cloak-and-dagger intrigue has the reassuring aroma of a home-cooked meal. There are no jihads or terrorists in sight and no apocalyptic scenarios, only dirty little secrets, as spies, counterspies from Russia and America tangle in a grubby story involving oil, sold secrets, murders and cover-ups. In this sequel to &quot;The Bourne Identity,&quot; many of the major hands who created the first film have returned, including Matt Damon as Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), the C.I.A.-trained assassin who can't remember his name or exactly why he's being hunted by everybody. As before, he spends almost the entire movie on the run. The movie reminds you that rhythms of film editing and collage making have allowed Hollywood to make the chase movie a surefire format.

"305",4,"Garden State","",1,"Stephen Holden","First, Go Cold Turkey, Then Go to Cold Jersey","This small, smart, off-kilter comedy has the cheek to present itself as &quot;The Graduate 2004,&quot; although its affectionate subversion of a popular classic also stamps it as &quot;The Anti-Graduate 2004.&quot; From its story of the waking up of an emotionally numbed young man (Zach Braff) to its editorial use of a contemporary pop soundtrack, the movie obsessively refers to that 1967 generational landmark. The New Jersey suburban landscape to which Andrew, Mr. Braff's 26-year-old alter ego, returns from self-imposed exile in Los Angeles is a universe apart from the lotus land where he has lived in for the last nine years in a chemical stupor. Because &quot;The Graduate&quot; established the stock vision of suburban alienation that has persisted through  &quot;American Beauty&quot; and beyond, you expect &quot;Garden State&quot; to uphold the cliché. Instead, it allows Andrew to discover some nuggets of spiritual gold in the East Coast wasteland he dreaded revisiting. As precocious filmmaking debuts tend to be, &quot;Garden State'' is too self-conscious by half, but its struggle to revitalize a cliché by turning it inside out is a worthy one. — Stephen Holden","2004-07-28","2004-08-20","2017-11-02 04:18:04","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/28/movies/film-review-first-go-cold-turkey-then-go-to-cold-jersey.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of Garden State'}",NA
"306",5,"Festival Express","R",1,"Dave Kehr","A Legendary Train Ride Through Rock's Fabled Past","In the summer of 1970, a pair of Canadian rock promoters, Ken Walker and Thor Eaton, assembled an amazing list of performers for a five-day tour that would begin with a concert in Toronto and then travel by train to Winnipeg and Calgary.  The talent included Janis Joplin, the Grateful Dead, the Band and &#151; for the same now-mysterious reasons they turned up in Woodstock &#151; the oldies band Sha-Na-Na.   But because of a fight between the festival promoters and the producers of the movie, the footage was never edited and never seen.  It has now been reclaimed and cut into dynamic form by the music documentary specialist Bob Smeaton (&quot;The Genesis Songbook&quot;).   What Mr. Smeaton has created is, in effect, a brand new film from 1970.  Respecting the cinema-vérité style and technical limitations of the time (the grainy 16-millimeter film stock looks wonderfully like grainy 16-millimeter film stock), &quot;Festival Express&quot; seems to step directly out of its period, and is guaranteed to thrill both survivors of those times and younger viewers who may know little of them. &#151; Dave Kehr","2004-07-30","","2017-11-02 04:16:23","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/30/movies/film-review-a-legendary-train-ride-through-rock-s-fabled-past.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of Festival Express'}",NA
"307",6,"The Manchurian Candidate","R",1,"A. O. Scott","Remembrance of Things Planted Deep in the Mind","Jonathan Demme, updating John Frankenheimer's classic exercise in cold war liberal paranoia, wisely treats the original as a touchstone, rather than a template, and his movie, in spite of some narrative flaws, stands on its own as a witty, anxious thriller for a new age of political uncertainty. Denzel Washington plays Ben Marco, a Gulf War veteran haunted by nightmares who tries at once to hold onto his sanity and to unravel a conspiracy that reaches the highest levels of corporate and political power. Liev Schreiber is a young congressman propelled toward the vice presidency by his monstrous mother, played with ice-chomping glee by Meryl Streep. The convolutions of the story are less important than the vigor of the performances, and the movie wears its attenuated political relevance lightly. Which may a good thing, since this &quot;Candidate&quot; is, in the end, a breathless and intricate thriller about the continuing need for campaign finance reform. — A. O. Scott","2004-07-30","2004-07-30","2017-11-02 04:18:04","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/30/movies/film-review-remembrance-of-things-planted.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of The Manchurian Candidate'}",NA
"308",7,"Intimate Strangers","R",1,"Stephen Holden","Erotic Suspense After Mistaken Identity","In this sardonic psychological thriller, Sandra Bonnaire portrays a Gallic answer to one of Alfred Hitchcock's sleek blond women of mystery. Imagine the Grace Kelly of &quot;Rear Window&quot; or the Kim Novak of &quot;Vertigo&quot; sprawled seductively on an analyst's couch, smoking cigarettes and confiding her sexual frustration to a repressed, wide-eyed shrink who is obsessed with her. The movie establishes a mood of playful erotic suspense in the first 10 minutes and sustains its cat-and-mouse game between therapist and patient through variations that are by turns amusing, titillating and mildly scary. The running joke is its revelation at the outset that the shrink (Fabrice Luchini) is not really a therapist but a repressed, lonely tax accountant.  Ms. Bonnaire's troubled character has accidentally strayed into the wrong office, located  on the same floor where the psychoanalyst she intended to consult practices a few doors  away.  The movie takes place less in the real world than in the realm of voyeuristic fantasy, in other words, in the realm of film itself. In the spirit of the best Hitchcock, it is seriously light. Or is it lightly serious? — Stephen Holden","2004-07-30","2004-09-03","2017-11-02 04:18:04","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/30/movies/film-review-erotic-suspense-after-mistaken-identity.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of Intimate Strangers'}",NA
"309",8,"Collateral","R",1,"Manohla Dargis","Killer in a Cab, Doing His Job","In &quot;Collateral,&quot; the edgy new thriller from the director Michael Mann, the city never sleeps, it doesn't even relax. Set in Los Angeles mostly after dark, after the city's sunshine has given way to cool noir, the story centers on a taxi driver, Max (Jamie Foxx), and the assassin, Vincent (Tom Cruise), who hops a ride with him deep into the night. Pitched between interludes of anxious intimacy and equally nerve-shredding set pieces, &quot;Collateral&quot; scores its points with underhand precision. The film is about a lot of different things, about how Los Angeles lights up even at night, how cars become prostheses of our selves and how driving with the radio on can be bliss. But as with all of Mr. Mann's movies, &quot;Collateral&quot; is finally about men and work, and about how being a man is itself a kind of job, which explains why this fastidiously crafted commercial film isn't just an entertainment, but a statement of personal faith. — Manohla Dargis","2004-08-06","2004-08-06","2017-11-02 04:18:04","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/06/movies/film-review-killer-in-a-cab-doing-his-job.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of Collateral'}",NA
"310",9,"Stander","R",1,"Stephen Holden","A Policeman Turns Against Apartheid and Becomes a Bank-Robbing Folk Hero","In its first half-hour, &quot;Stander,&quot; which tells the true story of Andre Stander (Tom Jane), the Johannesburg police chief who in 1976 turned against an apartheid system he found repugnant, and became a notorious serial bank robber, plays like a smoothly executed, if predictable drama of one man's heroic rebellion. Just when you begin to relax and wait for the usual buttons to be pushed, it swerves in more  uncertain direction and becomes an unsettling character study of a man self-destructively  addicted to flouting authority that is camouflaged as a heist movie. The further the volatile title  character evolves into a swaggering self-styled Robin Hood, the more his luster begins to  tarnish. Much of the film's considerable power lies in Mr. Jane's raw physical dynamism. — Stephen Holden","2004-08-06","","2017-11-02 04:16:22","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/06/movies/film-review-policeman-turns-against-apartheid-becomes-bank-robbing-folk-hero.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of Stander'}",NA
"311",10,"Cowards Bend the Knee","",1,"Manohla Dargis","Just Like Great-Grandpa's Peep Show","All good filmmakers have a sense of film history; for the Canadian director Guy Maddin it's a history that cuts to the marrow. The filmmaker's obvious inspirations are culled from silent cinema and those first few years when movies learned to talk, but he evinces an appreciation for proto-cinematic forms as well. (He doesn't just delight in early movies, when women possessed rosebud mouths and men had manners as slick as pomade, he exudes in the splotches, accidental jump cuts and ragged edges that can cling to well-used movies.) Mr. Maddin's interest in the atavistic takes wonderful shape in his latest offering, a love story that was originally designed as an installation art piece in which 10 different chapters were viewed through separate peepholes. Since its conception, the film has been stitched into a near-feature-length movie and no longer will viewers need risk eyestrain and cramped necks to appreciate Mr. Maddin's singular genius. Raincoats, however, remain optional. &#151; Manohla Dargis","2004-08-11","","2017-11-02 04:16:22","{'type': 'article', 'url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/11/movies/film-review-just-like-great-grandpa-s-peep-show.html', 'suggested_link_text': 'Read the New York Times Review of Cowards Bend the Knee'}",NA
"312",11,"Bright Young Things","R",1,"A. O. Scott","Social Butterflies Grounded by War","Stephen Fry, a noted actor and sometime novelist, makes his directing debut with this adaptation of Evelyn Waugh's &quot;Vile Bodies,&quot; considered by many to be the funniest novel ever written in English. The movie honors its source with vigor and gusto, capturing both Waugh's cheeky humor and his dark, stringent moralism. Stephen Campbell Moore and Emily Mortimer are touching and funny as the central couple, an impecunious aristocrat named Adam Symes and his long-term fiancée, Nina, but the picture is brought to life by its large supporting cast of both well-known and unknown British actors (and one Canadian, Dan Ackroyd, playing a blustering press baron). The chaotic plot follows a gaggle of twittering, gilded youth through the cynical, gossip-ridden social whirl of pre-World War II Britain. The parallels with the present are obvious without being overdone, and Mr. Fry's exuberant, occasionally messy film departs from the usual stuffy conventions of costume drama. — A. O.
